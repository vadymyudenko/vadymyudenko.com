The vision of the Joint Trauma System is that every soldier, marine, sailor, or airman injured in the battlefield or in the theater of operations has the optimal chance for survival and maximal potential for functional recovery. @eastridge2012

Most battlefield casualties die of their injuries before ever reaching a surgeon. As most deaths are NS, mitigation strategies to impact outcomes in this population need to be directed toward injury prevention. To impact the outcome of combat casualties with PS injury, strategies must be developed to mitigate hemorrhage on the battlefield, optimize airway management, and decrease the time from point of injury to surgical intervention.
