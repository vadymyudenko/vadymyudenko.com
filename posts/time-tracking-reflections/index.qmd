## Goodhart's law

"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure".

- how fixation on measuring/tracking takes precedence over what you measure/track


## Less is more

- how keeping things simple helps you long term


## Reducing cognitive pressure

- make the process simple, brain-dead, easy to do


## Enjoying life

- how being present in the moment is much more important than tracking

## Closing thoughts
