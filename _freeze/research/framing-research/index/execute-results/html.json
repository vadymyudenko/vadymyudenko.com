When it comes to money people are believed to be more rational and make less irrational mistakes. This is what we set out to test with our experiment. How noise (too much unnecessary information influences our decision). To test this we have created a survey to test with standard questions for control group and modified questions for treatment group. We are looking to see if there is a difference in responses. To test if the difference is significant we use chi-squared test of independence. Quantitative results of tests are presented. Potential for improvement of our methodology is discussed.\n\n# Methodology\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Results\n\n![](slide6.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](slide7.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWhat determines the test score in our experiment? To answer this question we created dummy variables from education and gender (NAs were committed). Our sample size is small (\\<30) so we should be cautious interpreting the results. But from a simple OLS regression we see that finishing masters and phd plays a role in getting a higher score. Other variables are not statistically significant.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n===============================================\n                        Dependent variable:    \n                    ---------------------------\n                               score           \n-----------------------------------------------\ncontrol                      -0.00001          \n                              (0.044)          \n                                               \nage                           -0.006*          \n                              (0.003)          \n                                               \nphd                           0.255**          \n                              (0.102)          \n                                               \nmasters                       0.175**          \n                              (0.066)          \n                                               \nbachelors                     0.123*           \n                              (0.069)          \n                                               \nConstant                     0.583***          \n                              (0.099)          \n                                               \n-----------------------------------------------\nObservations                    28             \nR2                             0.359           \nAdjusted R2                    0.213           \nResidual Std.

To test this hypothesis we use chi-squared test of independence.\n\n![2.](chisq.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nOur NULL is that there is no difference in responses between control and treatment groups, alternative is that there is a difference between 2 groups. In the table below we present the results of testing question responses to condition (control or treatment).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            test.statistic dof p.value\nQuestion 1           4.044   2   0.132\nQuestion 2          16.206   2   0.000\nQuestion 3           3.348   3   0.341\nQuestion 4           3.877   3   0.275\nQuestion 5           0.201   3   0.977\nQuestion 6           3.906   3   0.272\nQuestion 7           3.047   3   0.384\nQuestion 8           0.456   2   0.796\nQuestion 9           4.480   3   0.214\nQuestion 10          4.379   3   0.223\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have found no evidence that increasing noise leads to different responses in control and treatment groups. Overall the difference is not statistically significant for most of the questions, inclusion of noise didn't have an significant effect on the answers. Question 2 is an exception and its reason for high test statistic is discussed in the next section.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn our experiment we treated noise equally and didn't differentiate between all the possible directions of its effect. This is not very precise because we can't measure in which direction has our noise pushed respondents.\n\nQuestions could be improved by not having multiple potentially correct answers, but one true. This way we can actually see if people deviate from the correct answer when noise is present. In other words, instead of doing a two sided test to see if there is any change we can use one-sided test with framing to push participants to answer a certain way. This will improve the accuracy and help find the effect of certain framing on respondent's answers.\n\nQuestion 2 had a mistake and no-one from control group got it right, while many from treatment group guessed it correctly.\n\nIn closing, it is important in such experiments to isolate the effect to measure it. In our case we looked for any effect (any change) from the ideally correct answer. While we might see significant difference in the larger sample and having replicated this experiment multiple times, our results don't show that introducing noise affects responses. In the future experiments we suggest to not look at any effect but try to see if inclusion of certain noise changes the responses.\n\n# References\n\n1.
