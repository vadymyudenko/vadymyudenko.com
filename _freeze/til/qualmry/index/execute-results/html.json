One of the most useful things I learned was how to read an article.\n\nWhen you have found an interesting article. How do you read it? Do you try to understand every word and sentence? The languages employed in academic writing are often very complex and jargon-heavy! \n\nQALMRI addresses this issue by providing a framework for reading an article.\n\nIt breaks down the process into five steps:\n\n## Question\n\nWhat is the question the author is trying to answer? What is the main point of the article? What is the author trying to convince you of?\n\nQuestions may be specific or broad. \n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"What plays the biggest role in winning TT?\"}\n\n<form name=\"form_16948\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_16948()\" method=\"post\"><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_1\" value=\"Eye contact\"><label for=\"1\">Eye contact</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_2\" value=\"Being on time\"><label for=\"2\">Being on time</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_3\" value=\"Knowing your audience\"><label for=\"3\">Knowing your audience</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_4\" value=\"Evoking emotion\"><label for=\"4\">Evoking emotion</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_5\" value=\"Being liked by the audience\"><label for=\"5\">Being liked by the audience</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_16948\" id=\"16948_6\" value=\"Structure\"><label for=\"6\">Structure</label><br><input type=\"submit\" value=\"check\"></form><p id=\"result_16948\"></p><script> function validate_form_16948() {var x, text; var x = document.forms[\"form_16948\"][\"answer_16948\"].value;if (x == \"Being on time\"){text = 'Of course!';} else {text = 'Yes, but noâ€¦';} document.getElementById('result_16948').innerHTML = text; return false;} </script>\n\n:::\n\n## Alternatives\n\nWhat alternative hypothesis does the athor consider? What alternative hypothesis can you think about? \nCritially assess the author's argument. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the author's argument?\n\n## Logic\n\n\"If X, then Y...\" statements\"\n\n## Method\n\nHow does author \n\n## Results\n\nWhat do you make of the results? Are they what you expected?\n\n\n## Inference\n\nWhat questions are left unanswered? What are the implications of the results? What are the limitations of the study? What are the next steps?\n\n\n\n\nSources: \nhttps://www.crumplab.com/ResearchMethodsLab/qalmri.html",
