You've already understood the main point of whatever that it is that they are trying to say, but you wait, let them finish - we need to show respect. After a certain threshold you can hear teeth grinding, eyes rolling, feet shuffling, fingers fidgeting and omnipresent yawning. You don't listen anymore, words fail to register flowing in and out of your head. All the while, the speaker (that someone) is oblivious to the damage he inflicts to others!\n\nNow this is an extreme case of bad communication of which we have all been the victim and the perpetrator. Good (effective) communication requires time to be taken into consideration. One doesn't have to talk for too long nor too short, but enough. When is enough? How to know how much one has to speak to deliver the message effectively? Also, what does effectiveness mean in the context of communication? Effectiveness in the military, for example, is about short and clear exchanges: \"Roger that!\", \"Copy that!\", \"Tango down\", \"Enemy 12 o'clock\" - its goal is to deliver information that can be acted upon immediately. For academics effective communication is about articulating hard science in such a way a 5 year old can understand. Depending on the context effectiveness means different things: getting away with a lie, convincing someone to partner up, getting a \"yes\", accurately giving a portrait of a criminal to the police.\n\nComing back to the example above, there are many things that might make us think someone would just shut up. Being overtime is one of them. I once heard a speech that took too long, the speaker kept repeating the same things over and over again. Later, to my surprise, the speech was voted as the best by meeting attendees - turns out the story was relatable and majority liked it. Others were okay listening much longer, while I was sent to a different dimension by the speech. This situation got me thinking just how important is the time in communication?[^1]\n\n[^1]: No doubt it is, but **\"can we quantify it?\"** is the main question of this research.\n\nMeasuring effectiveness of communication is not a straightforward task. In this article we study it via proxy with data from Toastmasters International, whose meetings have an impromptu session, where each participant is given 2 minutes to give a speech. After the last participant has concluded, everyone votes for the best speaker. Winning indicates an effective (good) speech, as it has achieved at least one of the following:\n\n-   was better than others;\n\n-   communicated idea clearly;\n\n-   was memorable or relatable;\n\n-   happened (!)\n\nThe following research looks at the data gathered during Toastmasters meetings and looks at how time of the speech is associated with speeches' effectiveness (winning) and a slew of other interesting hypotheses.\n\n![](images/ua_clubs.png){width=\"720\"}\n\n<div>\n\n### Toastmasters in a Nutshell\n\n\\*For people who hear about Toastmasters for the first time.\\*\\* This is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:\n\n1.  **Prepared speeches session:** usually 5-7 mins long given by Club members;\n\n2.  **Table Topics (TT)** **session:** 2 mins impromptu speeches (everyone can participate), one can volunteer to answer a question or will be chosen by a toastmaster;\n\n3.  **Evaluation session:** everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.\n\nToastmasters are more organized and formal compared to many speaking clubs. Many of its members are [middle-aged with higher education](https://www.toastmasters.org/resources/statistics-and-data-hub). These people value their time and that is why among the evaluators there is a Timer (Ta-da!). Timer's responsibility is to keep track of time and show colored signs to a speaker. Without going into much detail, [*green*]{style=\"color:green\"} is an early warning, [*yellow*]{style=\"color:yellow\"} - soon the time will be up, [*red*]{style=\"color:red\"} - time is up, finish your speech. Timer also tracks the time of each speaker and presents the Timer Report - sine qua non[^2] of this article.\n\n</div>\n\n[^2]: A necessary condition without which something is not possible \\[from Latin\\]\n\n## Data\n\nLike a famished mouse looking for breadcrumbs under the baker's table, the author was open-sourcing these reports from Telegram `<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 496 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:0.97em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:steelblue;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M248,8C111.033,8,0,119.033,0,256S111.033,504,248,504,496,392.967,496,256,384.967,8,248,8ZM362.952,176.66c-3.732,39.215-19.881,134.378-28.1,178.3-3.476,18.584-10.322,24.816-16.948,25.425-14.4,1.326-25.338-9.517-39.287-18.661-21.827-14.308-34.158-23.215-55.346-37.177-24.485-16.135-8.612-25,5.342-39.5,3.652-3.793,67.107-61.51,68.335-66.746.153-.655.3-3.1-1.154-4.384s-3.59-.849-5.135-.5q-3.283.746-104.608,69.142-14.845,10.194-26.894,9.934c-8.855-.191-25.888-5.006-38.551-9.123-15.531-5.048-27.875-7.717-26.8-16.291q.84-6.7,18.45-13.7,108.446-47.248,144.628-62.3c68.872-28.647,83.183-33.623,92.511-33.789,2.052-.034,6.639.474,9.61,2.885a10.452,10.452,0,0,1,3.53,6.716A43.765,43.765,0,0,1,362.952,176.66Z\"/></svg>`{=html}, Facebook `<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:steelblue;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M504 256C504 119 393 8 256 8S8 119 8 256c0 123.78 90.69 226.38 209.25 245V327.69h-63V256h63v-54.64c0-62.15 37-96.48 93.67-96.48 27.14 0 55.52 4.84 55.52 4.84v61h-31.28c-30.8 0-40.41 19.12-40.41 38.73V256h68.78l-11 71.69h-57.78V501C413.31 482.38 504 379.78 504 256z\"/></svg>`{=html}, some were written by author himself and other were transcribed from videos of the meetings.\n\nMost of the data was collected from Ukrainian TMCs: Chamber[^3], Arttalkers, Changemakers, Dniprohills, KOMA (UA-speaking) and Svoya Sorochka (UA-speaking). There are some reports from Japanese and Polish TMCs, but we will not be focusing on them.\n\n[^3]: Special thanks goes to Chamber and their Timer reports, without them this project would've taken much-much longer.\n\n<div>\n\n## Note on Timer reports\n\nTimer tracks everyone's time, as can be seen on the reports. Here we will be only looking at Table Topics **(TT)** session times. Reports usually have the following information useful for our analysis:\n\n1.  Speaker Name\n2.  Speech Time\n3.  Club\n4.  Date\n5.  TT winner[^4]\n\nI have looked at too much timer reports *(see examples by clicking on each Tab).* It is as boring as being a Timer - manual work, under-appreciated and no one really cares. However, I was delighted to come across some very fine reports - a bright spark in otherwise gloom sea of boringness. These people turned a mundane, just-get-it-over-with role and created something worthwhile - a memory. For a lurking, opportunistic Toastmasters anthropologist (author) that is for sure.\n\nBut by and large, reports are nothing special. Some people have created a nice Excel sheet to track the time, others write on piece of paper.\n\nI sense that some of you keen readers might have a suspicion that the author is a little crazy - going through hundreds of reports himself! Yes, he is; and while you hold that thought, hear this: some timer went to the trouble of writing down time to milliseconds (!), yet another specimen had written a start time (to milliseconds of course) and end time and subtracted the two to get a total time. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! You think I'm crazy?\n\nBut without these crazy reports, I wouldn't have went through with this article.\n\n::: panelset\n::: panel\n[1]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/1.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[2]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/2.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[3]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/3.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[4]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/4.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[5]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/5.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[6]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/6.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[7]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/7.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[8]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/8.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[9]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/9.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[10]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/10.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[11]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/11.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[12]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/12.jpg){width=\"720\"}\n:::\n\n::: panel\n[13]{.panel-name}\n\n![](images/13.jpg){width=\"500\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n</div>\n\n[^4]: There are many reports that don't include TT winner or times of some speakers. Some speaker volunteer two or more times, which complicates analysis.\n\nIn total there are 180 unique meetings in the dataset from 2018 till 2022. Some of the meetings were dropped due to NAs in at least one of the columns. Speaking of gender discrimination, there was none present in current dataset, as the number of men and women[^5] is almost equal.\n\n[^5]: The gender of the speaker was assigned post hoc, based on the reports/photos of the meeting, common sense and a little bit of prejudice :)\n\n    In cases where it was impossible to establish the gender of a speaker - the whole meeting was excluded.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_1d71e97bba7ed4e0337bd935c5f748e4'}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Gender </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> # of TT paticipants </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Proportion, % </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> Female </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 682 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 47.63 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> Male </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 700 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 48.88 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> NA </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 50 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3.49 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith regards to TT participants' names there are a total of 312 unique names[^6].\n\n[^6]: In reports the same people were reported under slightly different names. For example: Alexey/Aleksey/Alex/Oleksiy/Oleksey.... and their counterpart Cyrillic versions. To deal with this issue, all versions were renamed to Alex. Similar approach was taken with other names.\n\n    All Ukrainian names were translated to English.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAnd lastly we have Time of Table Topics (TT)! How TT works:\n\nYou have 2 minutes to answer a question or speak on the given topic. **To stay within time limits, the timer will show you [*green*]{style=\"color:green\"} sign when there is 1 minute left, [*yellow*]{style=\"color:yellow\"} when 30 seconds and [*red*]{style=\"color:red\"} when time is up.**\n\nIdeally you want to have an opening-body-conclusion short speech, but this isn't always possible. You can volunteer or be dragged on stage. The question may be familiar to you or something you haven't even thought about. That is all to say, there are many different things happening during TT sessions and winning it requires achieving many things. At the end of TT everyone votes for \"the best speech\" - **this is our dependent variable of interest.**\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question!\"}\nBefore we get to figuring out what it takes to win TT, given the information above how does the distribution of TT times look like? A, B, C or D?\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Answer\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\" style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nSurprising? Either way, it is peculiar how these times fall into one of natures patterns! One can also notice that there is a [fat?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution) right-tail - outliers.\n\n## Analysis\n\nIn this part we are going to try and answer some of the hardest philosophical questions, most pertinent questions!

The difference is not significant! The distributions closely resemble each other. *Women don't speak longer than men!*\n\nWomen actually speak a little less than men. However we cannot say that women ACTUALLY talk less! In the current study we only observe time taken to speak, however within these 2 minutes on stage, they might talk more (on average) than men. There seem to be report that women communicate ideas differently and [use more words](https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/leadership/articles/women-talk-too-much-simply-isnt-true-data-show/) like ah/uh/m-m-m/you know/so/like[^7].\n\n[^7]: Foreshadowing a future ah-counter perspective on winning TT?!\n\nStrangely enough, if the proportion of men in TT session increases - then TT session will be be shorter. Also, having more men speak during TT session is associated with lower TT times.\n\n### Do we speak longer online?\n\nIn-person conversations/presentation have you deal with people - you see/hear/feel/smell them every second of your speech. There are so many signals communicated non-verbally that we don't even notice them. During in-person meetings when you take too long to finish people start fidgeting, yawning, looking away, and you know you don't want to make them uncomfortable so you quickly wrap up your speech. Online you deal with avatars, the only means of communication with them (your audience) is by observing their reaction.

This part could be improved with more data.\n:::\n:::\n\n## How to win at TT?\n\nIn this last section we will find out what it takes to win TT session!\n\nFirst of all, what doesn't it mean \"to win\"? Winning means - majority voted for you and not someone else. Win can be attributed to 2 types of factors: internal and external. Internal factors can be broken down into articulation and story. Articulation is how well you communicate your idea/story: your vocal variety, vocal clarity, hand gestures, eye contact, stage movement, being timely, overall appearance, among other. Story has to do with your message to the audience. How clear is it, does it evoke emotion or make one think? Is there a flow to the speech, is it easy to follow?\n\nExternal factors can also be broken down into 2 categories: perception and environment. Perception is how your message is understood by the audience. This has to do with who those people are, what they find funny, what have they eaten before the meetings etc. Environment is the place where you give a speech. Zoom, in person, microphone quality, distance to the audience, acoustics...\n\n\n::: {.cell preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFlowchart made with [ggflowchart](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/introducing-ggflowchart/)\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"What do you think plays the biggest role in winning TT?\"}\n\n<form name=\"form_88982\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_88982()\" method=\"post\"><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_1\" value=\"Evoking emotion\"><label for=\"1\">Evoking emotion</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_2\" value=\"Being on time\"><label for=\"2\">Being on time</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_3\" value=\"Being liked by the audience\"><label for=\"3\">Being liked by the audience</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_4\" value=\"Structure\"><label for=\"4\">Structure</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_5\" value=\"Knowing your audience\"><label for=\"5\">Knowing your audience</label><br><input type=\"radio\" name=\"answer_88982\" id=\"88982_6\" value=\"Eye contact\"><label for=\"6\">Eye contact</label><br><input type=\"submit\" value=\"check\"></form><p id=\"result_88982\"></p><script> function validate_form_88982() {var x, text; var x = document.forms[\"form_88982\"][\"answer_88982\"].value;if (x == \"Being on time\"){text = 'Of course!';} else {text = 'Yes, but no…';} document.getElementById('result_88982').innerHTML = text; return false;} </script>\n\n:::\n\n**Next we look at a set of hypothesis:**\n\n-   [The last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT](#heading1);\n\n-   [The longer the speech the less likely is winning](#heading2);\n\n-   [Bonus: how to name your baby so it wins TT](#heading4)\n\n### Hypothesis 1: {#heading1}\n\n**The last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Win ~ Speaker Order\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\" style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n\n::: {.cell code_folding='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                              Individual Time            \n                       logistic             probit       \n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nSpeaker Order            0.009               0.005       \n                        (0.033)             (0.018)      \nObservations              679                 679        \nLog Likelihood         -278.435            -278.435      \nAkaike Inf.
