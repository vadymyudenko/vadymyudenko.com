This view is prevalent among\nUkrainians, who are on paper the most educated population in Europe\n\n:::: {.cr-section layout=\"overlay-center\"}\n::: {#cr-timeline}\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/story.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n@cr-timeline\n\n@cr-timeline\n\n@cr-timeline\n\n@cr-timeline\n\nWe have missed two years of student life due to covid, which could be\nthe reason we have bonded this much. @cr-timeline\n\nFrom the very first days there was a difference. Students actually\nwanted to study. @cr-timeline\n\nSo much so that we studied despite the power outages. We'd sit in the\nschool's basement. This would be fixed @cr-timeline\n\nAnd study on campus sometimes deep into the night. @cr-timeline\n\nBy the end of the first semester I was happy to have survived. I have\nfailed one class and had to retake it next year. @cr-timeline\n\nJanuary marked the start of the hardest period thus far with more\nadvanced courses. Whereas before I saw studying as a good thing to do.\nNow I saw that I can actually achieve smth. @cr-timeline\n\nThis intensity took it's toll as taking a nap a frequent occurrence. I\nwasn't the only one affected. @cr-timeline\n\nThere was no time to sleep, as our university had many guests come visit\nand talk to students. Sanna Marin, Ulf Kristensson, Mark Rutte\n@cr-timeline\n\nI started looking for an internship as early as April. We had more\nstudies in May-June. @cr-timeline\n\nThe ultimate test of one's knowledge is getting a job. For me it came\nnaturally, many of my peers and many more in other universities have to\nwork in addition to studying. Stipend if you manage to get one is so\nmeager, you can't live off of it. @cr-timeline\n\nI got a job as a junior researcher at Institute for Behavioral Studies.\nI would be working with prof. that initially sparked my interest in\nbehavioral economics! @cr-timeline\n\nLife as it is right now is very uncertain and one out to be prepared. In\n2022 I have attended millitary training courses at my hometown, now,\nhaving more time I took an intensive military course. @cr-timeline\n\nWhile we are on the topic. It's true that for many men getting a degree\nbecame a chance to buy time (student's are exempt from draft).\n@cr-timeline\n\nI took writing thesis seriously and have read extensively. @cr-timeline\n\nAdded pressure was from having to retake calculus from last year.\n@cr-timeline\n\nAll this yellow in the middle! Somebody was hurrying to finish by\nNovember 1st! @cr-timeline\n\nAnd I did! @cr-timeline\n\nLast step was thesis defence after which I became master @cr-timeline\n::::\n\n## Parting thoughts\n\nRussia's goal is achieved with the disolution of UA state.\n\nYes, western eduacation is worth it. It may not be for you, but it is\nwell worth it.\n\nUpportunity for social lift\n\n## Sources\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WgNa7StZO18?si=D7R2h3jzVL8ZhRFo\n\n<https://frontliner.com.ua/ukrainian-legion-training/>\n\n##  {#info}\n\nArticle by Vadym Yudenko\\\nMade using [Quarto](https://quarto.org),\n[closeread](https://closeread.netlify.app) and\n[R](https://www.r-project.org).\n\n\\\n\n\\\n",
