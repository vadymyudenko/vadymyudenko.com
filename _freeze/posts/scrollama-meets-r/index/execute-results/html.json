When you go to work, then you'll learn how things really work.\"\n\nWith this sound advice I moved to the capital to study managerial studies at Kyiv National Economics University, fortunate enough to secure a budget place. As a rather naive young man, I took that advice to heart. From the very beginning, I threw myself into the university experience—not just the academics, but the cultural and educational activities, both within the university and beyond. I became a class representative and an active member of the student council, immersing myself in what felt like the full spectrum of university life. \n\nI had taken that advice to heart: \"You won't learn anything useful at university.\" And, in many ways, it turned out to be true. My days were consumed by completing assignments, printing lab reports, and submitting tasks just to check boxes, rather than engaging in meaningful learning or truly understanding the material. Studying became a mechanical process, devoid of curiosity or purpose. Then came COVID, and later the war, and I found myself exactly where I had been four years ago—lost, unprepared, and facing the stark reality that I had absorbed little of practical use. I was forced to start over and rethink everything I believed about education.\n\nThis story is not just about earning a master's degree. It is the story of unlearning old habits and mindsets, embracing a new way of studying, and discovering what education truly means and what it should aspire to be.\n\n\n@cr-guide\n\nFrom October 2022 to January 2024 I've been tracking how I spend my time. At the end of each day—or sometimes during breaks or while commuting—I would open Excel and log what I had been up to in the preceding hours. And in the preceding hours I'd usually <span style=\"color: #FFD700;\">study</span>. This included attending classes, working on assignments, doing group projects, online courses and workshops. @cr-guide-study\n\nEvenings were often filled with <span style=\"color: #87CEEB;\">lively conversations with friends</span> about life, dreams, and the occasional heated debate over coursework. I’d spend time with fellow students doing homework together, sharing meals, or simply unwinding after a long day. Beyond my university circle, I had my own <span style=\"color: #8E44AD;\">tight-knit group of friends</span> who became a vital part of my life at the time. @cr-guide-social\n\nAs the intensity of <span style=\"color: #FFD700;\">studying</span> died down, I began exploring job opportunities, <span style=\"color: #C0392B;\">attending interviews</span>, and eventually landing a <span style=\"color: #C0392B;\">position in the summer</span> 2023. @cr-guide-work\n\nOf course, life wasn’t all about <span style=\"color: #FFD700;\">studying</span>, <span style=\"color: #C0392B;\">working</span>, and <span style=\"color: #87CEEB;\">socializing</span>. It took time to get to all of those things. Not forgetting to <span style=\"color: #99CC99;\">eat</span> in between. In my downtime, I found moments to breathe. Sometimes I’d pick up a book and escape into its pages for a while. And then there was <span style=\"color: #27AE60;\">everything in between</span>—chores, shopping, running errands, or just relaxing after a long day. @cr-guide-rest\n\n@cr-guide-sleep And then there was <span style=\"color: #3B4CC0;\">sleep</span>—or more often, the lack of it. My sleeping schedule was anything but regular. There were stretches when I’d go to bed near 2 a.m. every single night for two weeks, pushing through exhaustion as if rest were optional. It wasn’t always healthy, but it was undeniably part of the student experience. \n\n\n\n## Making Up for Lost Years\n\nCovid started it and war finished it. Offline education as it was prior to 2020, became a thing of the past. During the first two years of my undergraduate studies at KNEU, I spent time with my group mates—talking about life, hanging out between classes. Then classes went online, students home and social life out of the window. \n\nEven when we did meet up in person, our ranks had thinned. By 2020 and 2021, it wasn’t the same anymore. Some students started working full-time, others returned to their hometowns, and the once-familiar faces became fewer and farther between.\n\nTo be honest, back then, I didn’t mind. I was happy not having to show my face in a classroom every day. Passing courses felt easier, too—if you know what I mean. But after those two years of isolation, compounded by the early months of the full-scale invasion, I realized just how much I missed that part of student life. The pent-up energy from those years of seclusion had to go somewhere. \n\nWhen I got into my master’s program at KSE, it was clear I wasn’t alone in feeling this way. Our new cohort was so eager to study together, to be together, and to make up for those two lost years.\n\n\n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"0%,0%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"55%,55%\" scale-by=\"2.15\"}\n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"-0%,55%\" scale-by=\"2.15\"}\n\nFrom the first days we'd gather on campus to listen to online lectures and do HWs together. University was our safe heaven. \n\nIt wasn't all fun and games. People here were extremely hardworking and did their best to understand the material. Despite many having a part-time job in addition to their studies everyone busted their ass and worked hard. The sight of student falling asleep from exhaustion was unimaginable but here this was usual.\n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"-50%,45%\" scale-by=\"2.1\"}\n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"-50%,25%\" scale-by=\"2.1\"}\n\nThere were power outages and air alerts. We were required to leave classrooms and move to the shelter in the basement. On some days we had power outages. We'd study in the basement with no lights. Our institution was doing it's best to provide studying facilities and we reciprocated by doing our best.

Deadlines kept us working until midnight, and after that, it was board games and quiet conversations until morning. What our group understood is that studying is also about community building, the people who study with you.

I attended lectures and seminars, did weekly homework. But there was so much ground to cover, and my shallow understanding wasn’t enough. I went to the exam, where I got a ticket with questions I had no answers to. \nSitting there in a class packed with students, looking at the sheet of paper, I heard the whisper from inside \"you're screwed\". A quick glance to my sides revealed the play I’d unwittingly become part of—a play that would repeat itself many times over and one I’d eventually participate in myself. One side tried very hard to look for and not find cheating, and another to not cheat while cheating. \n\nI got an abysmal and ego-bruising 9 out of 100, which sent me, along with three other 'backward' students, to a retake it in a week. That week was stressful and I did my best to prepare. On retake day, the four of us sat in a nearly empty classroom. I wrote what I could and passed—not without help of a student who came more prepared than me—they sneaked me a much needed *shpora*. As I turned in my answers I got a stern look from professor and an admonition \"to think what I do with my life.\" \n\nI wasn't the brightest, but I took classes seriously. that I could memorize and understand everything we were taught. But that first semester taught me something else: being serious wasn’t enough. Seeing those who cheat get ahead, and those who don't study at all somehow stay in the pack made me wonder what am I doing there. \n\nAt the time it was convenient to put the blame on professors. Boring, uninteresting, teaching obsolete things, not practical... there was plenty of professors who just went through the motions and didn't care about students. Some genuinely wanted us to learn and succeed. I experienced this firsthand when one professor went out of their way to help me pass a difficult course. But by doing so he did me a bear's service. As It looked like professors were encouraged to keep students and not fail them. And thusly, we learned that there are no consequences to failing. You always had a second, even a third chance. To ease the first chance it wasn't uncommon for teacher during exams to leave the room to 'get a coffee'. Strangely, I sometimes wished they had failed me, forced me to face the music earlier. Maybe then I would have learned what it really means to study and grow up.\n\nMaybe this is a game, those are the rules. And I learned to play the game. Once I have figured it'd be easier to fail a class, because retaking was much easier. I'd ignore it and then at the end of semester a teacher would give me an opportunity to make-up with a massive test, which you cannot fail, or do a favor of translating an article, or preparing a presentation. Hours of studying saved—that was a win in my book. \n\nWhen finally during the second year appeared one visiting professor who challenged the status quo. He wanted us to work and learn. He'd spent extra hours with students to make sure they understood the material. He'd bombard us with homework and would actually check if you did the job. For his efforts he got resentment and displeasure of the whole group. There was nothing he could do with this culture of impunity. Studying has turned into submitting tasks. And had little to do with learning. We were taught, but we didn’t truly learn.\n\nLooking back, I see how wrong I was about what studying is. It’s hard. It’s not supposed to be easy. You’re meant to fail, to wrestle with problems, to struggle until you find a solution—not memorize the answer and forget it the next day. Studying is about thinking critically, questioning your understanding, and challenging yourself. None of this is trivial. For me, the realization came almost too late.\n\n\n[@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"0%,-8.5%\" scale-by=\"1\"} \n\nMy best was not enough to pass all the courses. I had failed one calculus course, averaging a meager 70. A mark, a year before, I had to lift my finger to get, I had to sweat for to get. There were no retakes, I fail and had to retake the course in a year. If before I could juggle 2 F, now they'd get me expelled. And the threat was real. Students were expelled, their results annulled.\n\nStudent's attitude was different, too. Despite us complaining about some professors, everyone understood that it is their responsibility to learn. No shifting the blame on professors or anyone for that matter—if you've failed it was you. \n\nHere, the rules weren’t just different—they were enforced. Breaking them had consequences, real ones. And while I had been fine skirting the rules before, watching others struggle, problem-solve, and genuinely try to learn made me start to change too.\n\nJanuary marked the start of the hardest period thus far with more advanced courses. From day one I struggled to keep up and would sit deep into the night to read up on the material. [@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"0%,-12%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nThis intensity took it's toll as taking a nap became a frequent occurrence. Many had burnouts. [@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"25%,-20%\" scale-by=\"1.45\"}\n\n![](img/sleeping.png) [@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"25%,-20%\" scale-by=\"1.45\"}\n\nWhat is worse, there was no time to sleep, as our university had many guests come visit and talk to students. Sanna Marin, Ulf Kristensson, Mark Rutte to name a few. What they achieved is much needed morale boost and we trudged on. [@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"-50%,-55%\" scale-by=\"2.15\"} \n\nFebruary, March, now April. Studying continued as usual. New courses, new challenges, some fun, some bloody difficult. I got used to intensity and have pretty much caught up with the rest. My grades improved. \n\n[@cr-timeline-lost]{pan-to=\"0%,-50%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nThe ultimate test of one's knowledge is getting a job. I have applied to multiple positions, some found me, but I've chosen the one that wanted most. Starting August 2023 I'd be working in the Institute for Behavioral Studies as a junior researcher. [@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"-50%,-45%\" scale-by=\"2.15\"} \n\n[@cr-timeline-reality]{pan-to=\"0%,-50%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\n\n\n## War\n\nStudying during war feels wrong. One can tell oneself stories of post-war reconstruction and need for specialists. But there in the moment while you're really struggling to with your HW, guys your age put their life on the line. It's not that whatever it is you are working on is not hard, but compared to them it is nothing. You can start tomorrow, for some of them there is no tomorrow. And you feel miserable. You think you're simply wasting your time.\n\nFurther devaluing studying is how it became a gateway for people to dodge draft, buy time or otherwise safeguard themselves from the army. Some consider it \"[...a better option compared to paying thousands of dollars and escaping](https://ngl.media/en/2023/07/12/how-ukrainian-universities-make-profit-from-the-war/)\". \n\nNews come in of further advances and shortage of personnel. You just dive in the textbook and push the thoughts away. Two emotions went hand in hand. Guilt that my seemingly peaceful existence is sheltered by the bodies of my peers. And fear. These emotions made me do my best to apply myself at studying and research. And I did, meanwhile preparing for when I have to take up arms.\n\n\n[@cr-timeline-war]{pan-to=\"0%,-50%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nIn summer 2023 I've enrolled in a military training program for civilians. We'd train each weekend for 4 weeks and have lectures during the week. We were trained in weapons handling, tactical medicine (MARCH), orientation and [@cr-timeline-war]{pan-to=\"-50%,-70%\" scale-by=\"2\"}\n\n![](img/war_1.jpg) ...digging trenches. [@cr-timeline-war]{pan-to=\"35%,-65%\" scale-by=\"1.75\"}\n\nThere were a few young men, my age, most were older and expected to be drafted sooner or later. For them this course is a stepping stone to a place in a better regiment, an opportunity to learn as much as possible before deployment. They had no illusions of a gamble one took in going anywhere, they took matters in their own hands. When they are there they'd know a thing or two and would teach it to their comrades.

The most dreadful word for a student.  It’s the final hurdle standing in the way of many students and their degree. Rarely have I found a student that enjoyed working on their thesis paper or liked doing research for that matter. For most, it’s just something to get over with—another assignment that feels like it adds no real value.  \n\nNot everyone sees the point of putting effort into a thesis, and not everyone plans to get a PhD. Many students from top institutions aim for industry jobs where their skills can earn them high salaries and stable careers. Academia, by comparison, offers little in the way of tangible rewards.\n\nEven so, I believe universities should encourage students to take their theses more seriously. A thesis isn’t just another box to tick—it’s a testing ground for everything a student has learned. It’s an opportunity to show what they’re capable of. A well-written thesis on a topic that interests the student can be a strong selling point. It’s evidence of prior work and expertise that can make a difference when competing for high-paying jobs.\n\nFor me, the idea of doing research was appealing from the start. I think it is my masochistic nature. This 'nature' not only cost me hundreds of excruciating hours writing and rewriting, but even after it was done it was a source of brain damage. \n\nGetting a lower grade in a difficult course is one thing, but hearing someone casually claim they wrote their thesis in under a week? That’s a whole new level of demoralizing. Sure, prior knowledge and the complexity of the topic matter, but still. My thesis took me no less than five months of relentless effort. 2 months to set up a prior experiment to test the initial hypotheses, then another month of extensive literature review and refinement of hypothesis; then 3 more months to finalize the survey, analyse the data and write the damn thing. \n\nA week, you say? My ass!\n\n\n[@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-55%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\n[@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-65%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nI was writing a thesis about the impact of war on people's choices with brilliant advisers—Tymofiy Brik, Volodymyr Vakhitov, and Nataly Zaika. The idea for the paper came from an observation: certain decisions seemed to be put off because of the war. Depending on how someone perceives their circumstances, their reactions—and by extension, their decisions—can vary dramatically. To buy or keep renting? To save or spend? [@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-65%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nIn August-October I'd regularly discuss progress with my thesis advisers. Whether online or in-person, these sessions were invaluable. I’d present my challenges, share my questions, and they’d offer thoughtful advice to help me move forward. [@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-65%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\nI’d always believed I was naturally good at writing. In my head, I could craft complex arguments, using elegant language to tie everything together. But the moment I tried to put those thoughts on paper, the illusion shattered. The last two weeks before submission were particularly brutal. I wasn’t naturally good at this, and it showed. I wrote and rewrote the results section over and over, trying to piece it together in a coherent way. It was grueling and exhausting.  [@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-72.5%\" scale-by=\"1.2\"}\n\nAnd, of course, life didn’t stop while I worked on my thesis. I had a job and multiple projects to juggle. In the closing minutes of October I've at last, after a week-long marathon, submitted my thesis. I was proud, but more so relieved.\n\nIn the month between submission and defense, I retook the courses I’d failed the year before and worked longer hours. But preparing for the defense loomed over everything. Writing a thesis is a miserable experience: you feel incompetent every step of the way—until defense day, when you have to convince a committee that you’re not.\nWhen my time came, I stood before the committee, half an hour later I was done.  [@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-75%\" scale-by=\"1.2\"}\n\n![](img/grad_ceremony.png) Fast forward to July 2024, when we got official ceremony. I finally got my paper. \n\n[@cr-timeline-paper]{pan-to=\"0%,-77.5%\" scale-by=\"1\"}\n\n\n\n## Future?\n\nUniversity, at its best, does more than just teach subjects—it builds character. It teaches us how to conduct ourselves, to approach life with honesty, and responsibility. After all, every society needs competent and ethical leaders—in government, in businesses, and in our daily lives. Leaders who know how to work hard and who are willing to help others succeed.\n\nBut even the strongest university culture can only do so much. Ultimately, it’s up to the student to seize the opportunity, to go beyond what is asked, and to truly engage with their learning. Too often, cheating and shortcuts overshadow genuine effort. Yet, I believe this can change.\n\nThere is a future for Ukrainian students. Good universities and programs exist, and while private institutions lead the way for now, several national universities are stepping up as well. With the right guidance, strong values, and a commitment to nurturing both intellect and character, these institutions can help students not only succeed academically but also shape a better society.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I realize how fortunate I’ve been to meet brilliant people who studied beside me. Their dedication, intellect, and integrity are a testament to what good education can foster. To my teachers and friends, I say:\n\n> You've made a human out of me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<script>(function() {\n  var scroller = scrollama();\n  scroller.setup({\"step\":\".level1\",\"offset\":0.2,\"debug\":true})\n    .onStepEnter(res => {\n      res.element.classList.add(\"is-active\");\n    })\n    .onStepExit(res => {\n      res.element.classList.remove(\"is-active\");\n    });\n  window.addEventListener(\"resize\", scroller.resize);\n})();</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
