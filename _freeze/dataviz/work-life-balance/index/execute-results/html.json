Yes, that student is me! From October 2022 to January 2024, I have been [time tracking my daily life](https://vadymyudenko.com/posts/night-guy-morning-guy/), and this plot is an attempt to measure study-life balance of my student times.\n\nYou're looking at a [ternary plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot). They are used to represent the proportion of 3 variables as positions in a triangle. Here, I use it to show the study-life balance. Points toward the [<b>BOTTOM LEFT</b>]{style=\"color:darkred;\"} of the triangle represent days with more [<b>study</b>]{style=\"color:darkred;\"}[^1], those few toward the [<b>BOTTOM RIGHT</b>]{style=\"color:darkblue;\"} have more [<b>sleep</b>]{style=\"color:darkblue;\"}, and those toward the [<b>TOP</b>]{style=\"color:darkgreen;\"} is [<b>life</b>]{style=\"color:darkgreen;\"}—socializing, eating, going to the gym, shopping, watching cat memes and doomscrolling, and the list continues, capturing all the little moments that make up daily life.\n\n[^1]: This category is called Study for simplicity. It comprises of multiple activities: actual **Study**, **Work**, **Reading** and **Planning**.\n\nMajority of the days are centered around the barycenter (⬤) of the triangle, meaning that most days were mostly balanced. The cloud of point near the top right indicate days when I had little [<b>study</b>]{style=\"color:darkred;\"} and mostly relaxed or socialized. Meanwhile, points to the LEFT are days when I [<b>studied</b>]{style=\"color:darkred;\"} or socialized often at the expense of [<b>sleep</b>]{style=\"color:darkblue;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Study-Life balance in 2019-2020](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is also data from 2019-2020, when I first started time-tracking. Not much has changed since then. Occasionally, there are outliers—days with excessive studying or too much sleep—but overall, I have maintained a good balance between study, life, and sleep.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"How I did it?\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nI used the data from my time tracking, where I categorized each activity into one of the three categories: **Study**, **Life** and **Sleep**. Then calculated daily total hours and proportions for each of the above and plotted with [library(ggtern)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggtern/ggtern.pdf)\n:::\n\n## Inspiration and References\n\n[The Worst Tweeter In Politics Isn’t Trump (FiveThirtyEight)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-tweeter-in-politics-isnt-trump/)\n\n[Profiles of a divided country](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/02/22/profiles-of-a-divided-country)\n\n[Why use a ternary plot?](https://www.ownkng.dev/thoughts/ternary)\n\n[TernaryPlot.com](TernaryPlot.com)\n\n[Creating Ternary Plot with R](https://rpubs.com/tskam/ternary_plot)\n\n[datavizproject.com](https://datavizproject.com/data-type/ternary-contour-plot/)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
