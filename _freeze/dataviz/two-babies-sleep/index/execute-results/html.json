One of the them was a [post](https://www.relevantmisc.com/r/2020/06/01/baby-sleep-radial/) by Chris Riederer replicating \"[the most beautiful visualization of all time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/05/what-its-like-to-sleep-like-a-baby-visualized-by-a-dad/)\" by Wesley Elliott, who [visualized his daughter's sleep patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5l39mu/my_daughters_sleeping_patterns_for_the_first_4/).\n\nA visualization represents six months of [<b>sleep</b>]{style=\"color:#3f597b;\"} and [<b>wakefulness</b>]{style=\"color:#f7cfa3;\"} of a baby and contrasts it with a little over a year worth of [<b>sleep</b>]{style=\"color:#3f597b;\"} and [<b>suffering</b>]{style=\"color:#f7cfa3;\"} of a much older baby (yours truly). The spiral begins at the interior of the circle, marking the start of life for a baby. For the older baby, the spiral marks the beginning of *studying, deadlines,* and the slow demise of a healthy sleep schedule. The spiral then wraps outward as babies gets older — each full revolution of the circle represents one 24-hour day, meaning that midnight is at the top of the “clock” and noon is at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
