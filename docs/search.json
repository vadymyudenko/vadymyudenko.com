    "text": "On June 27th I was dinning out when at 15:44 sirens echoed through the downtown. Again… we had a siren just an hour ago… I think to myself waiting for my order. People around seemed not to notice a siren at all. A family of 4, probably well-off refugees from Kharkiv, immersing themselves in a friendly chatter, business lady in front struggling with a new QR-code menu and teenage girls snickering behind… what siren? Oh! You mean this annoying distracting sound? Well, we pretend not to notice it, we filter out, WE DON’T LISTEN. It is normal… now.\nYesterday was 1 month since the heinous terroristic act shocked my hometown to the core. In Ukraine, as a custom, we commemorate those who fell victims to the crimes of russia at 9AM with a minute of silence…\nAt 15:51 was a BIG BOOM — building shook lightly. It took some seconds before we realized what happened. NOW WE WERE LISTENING. 2nd explosion followed and we leaving everything behind rushed to a basement. It must be the bridge, surely, a man was saying to gasps of people nearby.\nThere was no connection. Call to check on your parents — no signal. Viber, WhatsApp — nothing. I’m not staying here, I need to make sure they’re okay. As I leave the shelter — smoke was in the air. It must’ve been somewhere close. When I came to Amstor 30 mins after the strike the building was on fire. Hundreds of people treading on shattered glass to see what happened to the place — air alert was off — there was nothing to destroy anymore…\nThere were hundreds in there! What if they stayed… like me? I stood there feeling the gravity like never before. Eyes fixed on the fire.\nAs sickening as it sounds, luckily only 20 were lost in the airstrike with 58 injured. Some left when they heard a siren, small shop owners went on a coffee break, while many stayed… Hundreds of kilometers away from a frontline you don’t expect an air strike on a civilian object in the center of your city. You just don’t!\nIhad to leave town for two weeks on the day of the attack on the mall, when I came back, without seeing the place, I could sense it’s presence. It is the smell… that multiplies russian propaganda about alleged storage of NATO supplied ammunition by zero. The smell of death, sorrow and pain of every Kremenchuk citizen. The smell of rotting products — meat, fish, veggies and fruits. Mall housed many both small and big shops including a supermarket. Now hundreds of tons of products that haven’t melted in the fire rot away under the rubble. One month after the strike, the smell is still there.\nPeople walk past the empty shell throwing glances at what was the mall. When you’re in the city you don’t feel the smell anymore, it is when you leave and come back is when you are reminded of the horrors of 27th. With the airstrike came a grim realization that nowhere is safe (except a shelter). Living under constant threat is our new normal.\nSince the onset of war there was no doubt Kremenchuk would eventually be targeted. The city, industrial center of Poltava region, is a hometown to Ukrtatnafta oil refinery (the largest in Ukraine), Kremenchuk Carbon Black Plant (the largest producer of carbon black in Ukraine), Kryukiv Railway Car Building Works (one of the largest in Ukraine and of strategic importance), Kremenchuk Automobile Assembly Plant, Kremenchuk Wheel Plant and the bridge which is a key railway junction across Dnipro river.\nAfter living with sirens for one month, Kremenchuk had it’s first ‘прильот’ (air strike) on the2nd of April — oil refinery was hit. The following strikes kept on hitting only the oil refinery, gradually destroying the giant. Still, citizens felt relative safety as the strikes were outside the city. That is, until…\nMy family owns an office in the center by a maternity hospital some 600 meters away from Amstor. In the building we have an actual bomb shelter and throughout April — June it has seen little interest from public. The first wave was in the first days of war, then, over time, people became habituated to the sirens. They became a daily reminder of a war happening somewhere not in this world. Right after strikes on Ukrtatnafta more people decided not to trust their luck and come to the shelter, but only for a day or two. This is best captured by a local Telegram channels with pictures of cats as residents of Kremenchuk.\nAmstor airstrike, horrific as it is, hasn’t and couldn’t have changed this trend. People can’t hide all the time, can’t always put life on hold… Except they do, seconds after another прильот, when the blast and shockwave tells you to run for dear life. Air strikes become a natural part of life… It is like on the morning radio they tell you a weather forecast… Dear citizens, today Kremenchuk is expecting a summery weather, comfy temperature and azure sky. Winds blow westward and the risk of ‘precipitation’ is PERMANENT. Have a great day, don’t ignore sirens and everything will be Ukraine!\n\n\n\nPeople gather around burning Amstor"

    "text": "A woman of 70. Born 200 km away from Moscow, she came to Ukraine with her husband and their small child in 1976 as they got a job at a car works. She looked after the kid and husband was providing for the family. In ten years, the Soviet Union collapsed and their life… didn’t change much. Her husband was still an engineer and she took an accountant position at a local military unit. In the late nineties their firstborn went to study in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, before coming home and settling. Nothing changed in the next ten years, the Orange Revolution, the 2008 crisis went past them. All the while they kept close ties with their family back in Russia. Visiting each other once a year or two. Sending family photos, letters and post cards.\nThen came the annexation of Crimea and occupation of Donbas, but conversations didn’t change much, only visiting each other was harder because of increased border checks. Life continued as normal until the 24th of February, 2022. On THE DAY there was no call, week passed by — still nothing. So she took initiative and gave them a call.\n“Aлло”, familiar voice answers the phone. “How are you?” “Good and you?” “Okay…”, they exchange a few civilities until the woman can’t contain herself anymore. She is not okay! She told about how russian soldiers are bombing our cities, about the sirens and the mall. They were not impressed and, as all respectable followers of the word of putin, repeated what their TV-scriptures say word for word. Denazification, Banderovites, “we don’t bomb civilians”, “those are fakes”… Her attempts to speak sense into them were futile. Distressed, she says goodbye and as she hangs the phone, it echoes…\n\n“…We all love you, and so does Putin” (Ми все вас любим, и Путин тоже)\n\n\nUkrainians now have a terrible time speaking with relatives in russia. Having to prove the REALITY of our suffering is infuriating. HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE NOT TRUE?! WHAT IS MORE REAL THAN PAIN? But these are the questions you unconsciously ask yourself after conversations with your, now very distant, relatives. One intercepted call that terrified me was of a Ukrainian woman calling her male relative, a militant of the so-called DNR, whose unit then/is still stationed in Kherson region.\nW: You explained to me about Banderites, I believed you. I hated them. Now, who should I hate? … Why are they like this, Seryozha? What are they raping children for? What is this?\nM: Who told you? Do you know this for sure? Or are these just rumors?\nW: I know for sure. *crying* I’m not telling anything more.\n\nYou can most certainly feel despair in her voice, when the man questions the REALITY of her experience. This conversation is emblematic of conversations Ukrainians have with their RU relatives. Any appeals to reason are met with ready-made answers (NATO, nazis, biolabs), facts are met with “fakes!” and emotions with “understanding and love”. After all they consider us their brothers…at least used to.\nUkrainians and russians are not brothers. For centuries Ukraine has been under Moscow’s rule. In Soviet times, especially, all things Ukrainian were persecuted. Horrible atrocities were committed to bring (not only) Ukrainian population under control — Holodomor, Dekulakization, Executed Renaissance. Those who weren’t killed, were sent to Siberia, spared lived under constant threat of being next.\nUsing wrong words or criticizing the official line was unacceptable. Despite that, there was freedom of speech in the Soviet Union, but no freedom after speech. Snitching on one’s neighbor was prevalent, so people learned to keep to themselves and live in silence. Now, in putinist russia narratives of decaying West, strong and mighty russia and of foreign agents reiterate those of Soviet era. And snitching is coming back.\n\nFear of punishment is not the only factor preventing relatives in russia from speaking out and protesting. Understanding that nothing is going to change, I-am-just-a-small-person mentality are also on the list. But the main reason is hands down — russian propaganda.\nIn a carefully constructed putinist worldview there is no room for logic and reason. It’s a constant stream of repetitive, often contradictory narratives, multiplied and spread in big volumes. This propaganda boils down to 2 things. 1st is that without putin russia can’t do. And 2nd — all the rest are wretched and corrupt (especially the West and America). The later is best exemplified in Navalny’s investigation of International Sawmill show (HERE, first 10 mins, has funny captions), where foreign leaders are made fun of and putin is the boss. All other things russian propaganda can sell to its audience. Look no further then “the gesture of goodwill” by russian army from Snake Island and negative emersion of Moskva flagship. Blasting people with conspiracy theories and half-baked news, at a rate they can’t keep up with, earned it a name — Firehose of Falsehood. And not only russians are susceptible to it.\nMany Ukrainians also fell victims to the propaganda and still believe in what it spews. One close friend of mine recounts conversations with their relatives who, after 24th of February, stayed in Kharkiv, in the city’s most shelled area — Northern Saltivka. There, under constant shelling, they continued to believe in the brave new russian world.\nLike any functioning society Ukraine has issues and problems. There are people who don’t need propaganda to be anti-ua and pro-ru and they have their reasons. Again, Ukraine has many problems we, Ukrainians, must solve. Nazis and rusophobia — two main justifications for full-scale war on Ukraine — are not them. Those who say otherwise are delusional, they’ve lost touch with reality and play into the hands of invaders. Of course, there are people who take a more radical stance on issues, just like everywhere in the world, but they are a minuscule minority, who have little to no effect on the country’s agenda. If you have a relative or a colleague who believes in persecution of all things russian before 2014, ask them why has russia invaded and razed to the ground the most pro-russian regions and cities? Plant the seed of doubt in their infertile soil.\nIn the 50 years that my grandma has been in Ukraine no one has said a word about her nationality (кацапка), her mother tongue, no one forced her to learn and speak Ukrainian. Yet, this is what our relatives in russia and some simple-minded compatriots are led to believe.\nGrandma is 71 now. Sitting on her armchair in the empty living room, she turns on TV to watch russian channels — old habits die hard. She still carries her cellphone in case THEY call, although she admits there is nothing to talk about anymore. On the table next to the remote there is a crossword magazine in Ukrainian — it’s hard, but she is trying. She is russian, was and will be, but above all things, she wants her grandchildren to be Ukrainian. To live in a free and peaceful country, to find their way, to marry (soon, grandma) and lead a fulfilling life.\n2 months into the war she, whose mother tongue is russian, who never learned Ukrainian, who was never forced to learn it and forget russian, wished me a happy birthday in Nightingalian*.\n*Ukrainians refer to Ukrainian as Nightingalian (Солов’їна)"

    "text": "Toastmasters in a Nutshell\nFor people who hear about Toastmasters for the first time. This is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:\n\nPrepared speeches: usually 5-7 mins long given by Club members;\nTable Topics (TT) session: 2 mins impromptu speeches (everyone can participate), one can volunteer to answer a question or will be chosen by a toastmaster;\nEvaluation session: everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.\n\nToastmasters are more organized and formal compared to many speaking clubs. Many of its members are middle-aged with higher education. These people value their time and that is why among the evaluators there is a Timer (Ta-da!). Timer’s responsibility is to keep track of time and show colored signs to a speaker. Without going into much detail, green is an early warning, yellow - soon the time will be up, red - time is up, finish your speech. Timer also tracks the time of each speaker and presents Timer Report - sine qua non2 of this article.2 A necessary condition without which something is not possible [from Latin]"

Reports usually have the following information useful for our analysis:\n\nSpeaker Name\nSpeech Time\nClub\nDate\nTT winner4\n\n\n4 There are many reports that don’t include TT winner or times of some speakers. Some speaker volunteer two or more times, which complicates analysis.I have looked at too much timer reports (see examples by clicking on each Tab). It is as boring as being a Timer - manual work, under-appreciated and no one really cares. However, I was delighted to come across some very fine reports - a bright spark in otherwise gloom sea of boringness. These people turned a mundane, just-get-it-over-with role and created something worthwhile - a memory. For a lurking, opportunistic Toastmasters anthropologist (author) that is for sure.\nBut by and large, reports are nothing special. Some people have created a nice Excel sheet to track the time, others write on piece of paper.\nI sense that some of you keen readers might have a suspicion that the author is a little crazy - going through hundreds of reports himself! Yes, he is; and while you hold that thought, hear this: some timer went to the trouble of writing down time to milliseconds (!), yet another specimen had written a start time (to milliseconds of course) and end time and subtracted the two to get a total time. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! You think I’m crazy?\nBut without these crazy reports, I wouldn’t have went through with this article.\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n13"

In the current study we only observe time taken to speak, however within these 2 minutes on stage, they might talk more (on average) than me.

There are so many signals communicated non-verbally that we don’t even notice them. During in person meetings when you take too long to finish people start fidgeting, yawning, looking away, and you know you don’t want to make them uncomfortable so you quickly wrap up your speech. Online you deal with avatars, the only means of communication with them (your audience) is by observing their reaction.

This part could be improved with more data."

There a lot that goes into giving a great speech and a lot more into winning, but speaker order doesn’t seem to be it. But one thing is clear as day here - the only people who don’t win are those that don’t try!"

Interestingly, that probability of winning TT is increasing with every second (!) removing outliers (150 seconds or higher) doesn’t change the probability. Conclusion: you want to speak for as long as and not a second more! Otherwise you’ll be disqualified.\nThink about how this finding plays out in your life.\nWhen you have someones attention you have to be mindful of time. You are not given their attention indefinitely, you have to use this opportunity exhaustively making every second count. Speak fast and blurt out your thought and they will not understand it fully. Speak too much and they switch off and feel like you can’t properly articulate your thoughts. You have to finish by the time they lose focus!"
