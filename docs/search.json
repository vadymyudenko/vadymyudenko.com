    "text": "Introduction\nConsider time as the invisible thread weaving through the fabric of every conversation, the silent drumbeat to which all effective communication must sync. It’s not just about being on time — though punctuality certainly speaks volumes — it’s also about respecting the rhythm of discourse, whether it’s a brief exchange or a lengthy dialogue.\nImagine the different scenarios: a toast at a family gathering, where brevity is laced with warmth; a debate, where each second is a battle for conviction; an elevator pitch, where within a minute, careers could be made or opportunities lost. While these situations differ wildly in content and context, one rule remains universally unchallenged: overrun your allotted time, and your message may fall on deaf ears — or worse, you might find yourself ‘toasted’!\nMoving beyond anecdotal evidence, we dive into the realm of data. To understand the practical implications of time (being in time, on time, overtime ) in communication, we’ve turned to a domain where time isn’t just a factor — it’s a contestant: the Toastmasters International meetings, specifically Table Topics session!\nIf you’re familiar with Toastmasters International, then jump straight to the results. If not - keep reading.\nToastmasters in a Nutshell\nToastmasters is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:\n\nPrepared speeches session: usually 5-7 minutes long speeches on various topics, these speeches are for members of the organization;\nTable Topics (TT) session: 2 minutes log impromptu speeches, everyone can participate, and the best speech is voted for;\nEvaluation session: everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.\n\nMost Toastmasters members are working professionals from different fields who want to network, be confident presenting, make new connections, and have a great time. Delivering prepared speeches allows members to structure their thoughts and practice their delivery. The Table Topics session, on the other hand, challenges members to speak impromptu. In this session, you can either volunteer to answer a question or be selected by the Table Topics Master. The essence of this activity is to encourage speaking “on your feet” rather than from the comfort of your seat.\nDuring the Evaluation session a Timer of the meeting - a person specifically assigned to the timetracking task - presents their report, sine qua non1 of this article. Timer’s responsibility is to keep track of time and indicate to the speakers how much time they have left before they have to wrap up. Without going into much detail, green is an early warning, yellow - soon the time will be up, red - time is up, finish your speech. At the end of the meeting a time has a report of speakers and their timings1 A necessary condition without which something is not possible [from Latin]"

    "text": "Data\nLike a famished mouse looking for breadcrumbs under the baker’s table, the author was open-sourcing these reports from Telegram , Facebook , some were written by author himself and other were transcribed from videos of the meetings.\nMost of the data was collected from Ukrainian TMCs: Chamber2, Arttalkers, Changemakers, Dniprohills, KOMA (UA-speaking) and Svoya Sorochka (UA-speaking). There are some reports from Japanese and Polish TMCs, but we will not be focusing on them.2 Special thanks goes to Chamber and their Timer reports, without them this project would’ve taken much-much longer.\n\n\nIn total there are 180 unique meetings in the dataset from 2018 till 2022. Some of the meetings were dropped due to NAs in at least one of the columns. Speaking of gender discrimination, there was none present, as the number of men and women3 is equal.\nThe gender of the speaker was assigned post hoc, based on the reports/photos of the meeting, common sense and a little bit of prejudice :)\nIn cases where it was impossible to establish the gender of a speaker - the whole meeting was excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\n# of TT paticipants\nProportion, %\n\n\n\nFemale\n682\n47.63\n\n\nMale\n700\n48.88\n\n\nNA\n50\n3.49\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to TT participant’s names there are a total of 312 unique names 4.\nIn reports the same people were reported under slightly different names. For example: Alexey/Aleksey/Alex/Oleksiy/Oleksey…. and their counterpart Cyrillic versions. To deal with this issue, all versions were renamed to Alex. Similar approach was taken with other names.\nAll Ukrainian names were translated to English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we have Time of Table Topics (TT)! How TT works:\nYou have 2 minutes to answer a question or speak on the given topic. To stay within time limits, the timer will show you green sign when there is 1 minute left, yellow when 30 seconds and red when time is up.\nIdeally you want to have an opening-body-conclusion short speech, but this isn’t always possible. You can volunteer or be dragged on stage. The question may be familiar to you or something you haven’t even thought about. That is all to say, there are many different things happening during TT sessions and winning it requires achieving many things. At the end of TT everyone votes for “the best speech” - this is our dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion!\n\n\n\nBefore we get to figuring out what it takes to win TT, given the information above how does the distribution of TT times look like? A, B, C or D?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprising? Either way, it is peculiar how these times fall into one of nature’s patterns!"

The difference is not significant! The distributions closely resemble each other. Women don’t speak longer than men!\nWomen actually speak a little less than men. However, we cannot say that women ACTUALLY talk less! In the current study we only observe time taken, but within these 2 minutes on stage, they might say more (on average) than men. There seem to be reports that women communicate ideas differently and use more words like ah/uh/m-m-m/you know/so/like5.5 Foreshadowing a future ah-counter perspective on winning TT?!\nStrangely enough, if the proportion of men in TT session increases - then TT session will be be shorter. Also, having more men speak during TT session is associated with lower TT times.\nDo we speak longer online?\nIn-person conversations and presentations require you to engage with people directly; you see, hear, feel, and even smell them throughout your speech. There are countless non-verbal signals that are communicated without us even noticing. During face-to-face meetings, if you take too long to finish, people may start fidgeting, yawning, or looking away. This indicates discomfort, prompting you to wrap up your speech quickly. In contrast, when interacting online, you are dealing with avatars, and the only means of gauging your audience’s reactions is by observing their responses. This may lead to a tendency to go overtime more often than if you were delivering the same speech in person. We will explore this further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Online/Offline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n======================================================\n                  Individual Time         TT Time     \n                        (1)                 (2)       \n------------------------------------------------------\nOnline/Offline         0.580            -178.118***   \n                      (1.916)            (26.812)     \nObservations           1,432               1,432      \nR2                     0.000               0.030      \nAdjusted R2           -0.001               0.029      \n------------------------------------------------------\nNotes:         ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n               **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n               *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the meeting is online or offline does not affect the length of TT speeches. However, there is a significant association with the total duration of TT sessions: on average, online TT sessions are longer than in-person ones by approximately 160 seconds (equivalent to about 1.5 speakers). One potential explanation for this is the influence of the global pandemic. Now, participants do not need to be physically present in a specific location to join a meeting, and, perhaps most significantly, there is no commute involved afterward—one is likely already home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the distribution of individual speeches remains “Normal” throughout the years, TT sessions became longer and take up to 40(!) minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n====================================================\n                Individual Time         TT Time     \n                      (1)                 (2)       \n----------------------------------------------------\nYear2012            34.977**            -130.545    \n                    (16.572)           (217.757)    \nYear2013            32.583**            -100.583    \n                    (16.279)           (213.902)    \nYear2016           45.750***             43.500     \n                    (16.918)           (222.294)    \nYear2017            36.850*              -1.000     \n                    (20.332)           (267.164)    \nYear2018           42.788***             73.423     \n                    (14.420)           (189.472)    \nYear2019           39.441***            321.941*    \n                    (13.331)           (175.163)    \nYear2020           43.136***           402.828**    \n                    (12.794)           (168.107)    \nYear2021           44.867***           467.536***   \n                    (12.719)           (167.132)    \nYear2022           46.424***           750.497***   \n                    (12.699)           (166.861)    \nConstant           61.750***           494.000***   \n                    (12.610)           (165.688)    \nObservations         1,432               1,432      \nR2                   0.013               0.155      \nAdjusted R2          0.006               0.150      \n----------------------------------------------------\nNotes:       ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n             **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n             *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAre there differences on the club level?\nFurther exploring the data, we look at whether some of the differences can be explained by looking at distributions at the club level.\n\n\nIndividual Time\nTT Session Time\nMen/Women Club\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual times don’t seem to vary that much across clubs, however KOMA (Ukrainian-speaking club) is an exception.

    "text": "How to win Table Topics session?\nIn this last section we will find out what it takes to win TT session!\nFirst of all, what doesn’t it mean “to win”? Winning means - majority voted for you and not someone else. Win can be attributed to 2 types of factors: internal and external. Internal factors can be broken down into articulation and story. Articulation is how well you communicate your idea/story: your vocal variety, vocal clarity, hand gestures, eye contact, stage movement, being timely, overall appearance, among other. Story has to do with your message to the audience. How clear is it, does it evoke emotion or make one think? Is there a flow to the speech, is it easy to follow?\nExternal factors can also be broken down into 2 categories: perception and environment. Perception is how your message is understood by the audience. This has to do with who those people are, what they find funny, what have they eaten before the meetings etc. Environment is the place where you give a speech. Zoom, in person, microphone quality, distance to the audience, acoustics…\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart made with ggflowchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat plays the biggest role in winning TT?\n\n\n\n\nEye contactBeing on timeBeing liked by the audienceKnowing your audienceEvoking emotionStructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we look at a set of hypothesis:\n\nThe last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT;\nThe longer the speech the less likely is winning;\nTime of other speakers has no effect on probability of winning\nBonus: how to name your baby so it wins TT\n\nHypothesis 1:\nThe last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Speaker Order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                              Individual Time            \n                       logistic             probit       \n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nSpeaker Order            0.009               0.005       \n                        (0.033)             (0.018)      \nObservations              679                 679        \nLog Likelihood         -278.435            -278.435      \nAkaike Inf.

There a lot that goes into giving a great speech and a lot more into winning, but speaker order doesn’t seem to be it. But one thing is clear here - the only people who don’t win are those that don’t try!\nHypothesis 2:\nThe likelihood of winning decreases as the length of the speech increases\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we have a dozen of TT winners who spoke over 150 seconds, we will remove them from our analysis and run regression with and w/o outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                                    TT                   \n                  Model with outliers  Model w/o outliers\n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nIndividual Time         0.008***            0.013***     \n                        (0.003)             (0.005)      \nConstant               -2.680***           -3.166***     \n                        (0.343)             (0.497)      \nObservations              679                 609        \nLog Likelihood          -274.566            -243.462     \nAkaike Inf.

Even removing outliers (150 seconds or higher) doesn’t change the significance. You still better speak for as long as and not a second more! Otherwise you’ll be disqualified!\nThink about how this finding plays out in your life.\nWhen you have someone’s attention, you have to be mindful of time. You are not given their attention indefinitely, you have to use this opportunity exhaustively, making every second count. Speak fast and blurt out your thought and they will not understand it fully. Speak too slow and they might switch off and think that you can’t properly articulate your thoughts.

    "text": "On June 27th I was dinning out when at 15:44 sirens echoed through the downtown. Again… we had a siren just an hour ago… I think to myself waiting for my order. People around seemed not to notice a siren at all. A family of 4, probably well-off refugees from Kharkiv, immersing themselves in a friendly chatter, business lady in front struggling with a new QR-code menu and teenage girls snickering behind… what siren? Oh! You mean this annoying distracting sound? Well, we pretend not to notice it, we filter out, WE DON’T LISTEN. It is normal… now.\nYesterday was 1 month since the heinous terroristic act shocked my hometown to the core. In Ukraine, as a custom, we commemorate those who fell victims to the crimes of russia at 9AM with a minute of silence…\nAt 15:51 was a BIG BOOM — building shook lightly. It took some seconds before we realized what happened. NOW WE WERE LISTENING. 2nd explosion followed and we leaving everything behind rushed to a basement. It must be the bridge, surely, a man was saying to gasps of people nearby.\nThere was no connection. Call to check on your parents — no signal. Viber, WhatsApp — nothing. I’m not staying here, I need to make sure they’re okay. As I leave the shelter — smoke was in the air. It must’ve been somewhere close. When I came to Amstor 30 mins after the strike the building was on fire. Hundreds of people treading on shattered glass to see what happened to the place — air alert was off — there was nothing to destroy anymore…\nThere were hundreds in there! What if they stayed… like me? I stood there feeling the gravity like never before. Eyes fixed on the fire.\nAs sickening as it sounds, luckily only 20 were lost in the airstrike with 58 injured. Some left when they heard a siren, small shop owners went on a coffee break, while many stayed… Hundreds of kilometers away from a frontline you don’t expect an air strike on a civilian object in the center of your city. You just don’t!\nIhad to leave town for two weeks on the day of the attack on the mall, when I came back, without seeing the place, I could sense it’s presence. It is the smell… that multiplies russian propaganda about alleged storage of NATO supplied ammunition by zero. The smell of death, sorrow and pain of every Kremenchuk citizen. The smell of rotting products — meat, fish, veggies and fruits. Mall housed many both small and big shops including a supermarket. Now hundreds of tons of products that haven’t melted in the fire rot away under the rubble. One month after the strike, the smell is still there.\nPeople walk past the empty shell throwing glances at what was the mall. When you’re in the city you don’t feel the smell anymore, it is when you leave and come back is when you are reminded of the horrors of 27th. With the airstrike came a grim realization that nowhere is safe (except a shelter). Living under constant threat is our new normal.\nSince the onset of war there was no doubt Kremenchuk would eventually be targeted. The city, industrial center of Poltava region, is a hometown to Ukrtatnafta oil refinery (the largest in Ukraine), Kremenchuk Carbon Black Plant (the largest producer of carbon black in Ukraine), Kryukiv Railway Car Building Works (one of the largest in Ukraine and of strategic importance), Kremenchuk Automobile Assembly Plant, Kremenchuk Wheel Plant and the bridge which is a key railway junction across Dnipro river.\nAfter living with sirens for one month, Kremenchuk had it’s first ‘прильот’ (air strike) on the2nd of April — oil refinery was hit. The following strikes kept on hitting only the oil refinery, gradually destroying the giant. Still, citizens felt relative safety as the strikes were outside the city. That is, until…\nMy family owns an office in the center by a maternity hospital some 600 meters away from Amstor. In the building we have an actual bomb shelter and throughout April — June it has seen little interest from public. The first wave was in the first days of war, then, over time, people became habituated to the sirens. They became a daily reminder of a war happening somewhere not in this world. Right after strikes on Ukrtatnafta more people decided not to trust their luck and come to the shelter, but only for a day or two. This is best captured by a local Telegram channels with pictures of cats as residents of Kremenchuk.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbatim: denizens in the hall during air raid alert at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbatim: denizens in the hall during air raid alert\n\n\n\n\nAmstor airstrike, horrific as it is, hasn’t and couldn’t have changed this trend. People can’t hide all the time, can’t always put life on hold… Except they do, seconds after another прильот, when the blast and shockwave tells you to run for dear life. Air strikes become a natural part of life… It is like on the morning radio they tell you a weather forecast… Dear citizens, today Kremenchuk is expecting a summery weather, comfy temperature and azure sky. Winds blow westward and the risk of ‘precipitation’ is PERMANENT. Have a great day, don’t ignore sirens and everything will be Ukraine!\n\n\n\nPeople gather around burning Amstor"

One of the them was a post by Chris Riederer replicating “the most beautiful visualization of all time” by Wesley Elliott, who visualized his daughter’s sleep patterns.\nA visualization represents six months of sleep and wakefulness of a baby and contrasts it with a little over a year worth of sleep and suffering of a much older baby (yours truly). The spiral begins at the interior of the circle, marking the start of life for a baby. For the older baby, the spiral marks the beginning of studying, deadlines, and the slow demise of a healthy sleep schedule. The spiral then wraps outward as babies gets older — each full revolution of the circle represents one 24-hour day, meaning that midnight is at the top of the “clock” and noon is at the bottom."

In 2020 I socialized throughout the day, whereas in 2022-2023 it is concentrated in the evening—studies and work have ousted them.\n2022-2024 was an extremely stressful and rewarding year. I have learned and achieved in this year more than in 4 years combined, I’d wake up and study, then rest a bit, then study again. There were burnouts, and added pressure because of power outages and war in general. Yet, when you look at the percentages… my life hasn’t changed much.\nIf you add  Japanese and university study time from 2019-2020, you’d have roughly the same average as in 2023.

The only thing Morning Guy can do is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy loses his job and Night Guy has no money to go out anymore.”\n– Jerry Seinfeld\n\nThe one messing up morning guy, the one partying (supposedly), the carefree one. In 2020 he knew his place, he was tame. Either chilling before going to bed (Miscellaneous -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Sleep) or studying, preparing and going to bed (Japanese -&gt; Miscellaneous -&gt; Sleep). Sometimes he’d waste some time, but only for 20 minutes before realizing it is time to stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNight guy of 2023 realized that wasting time is better in a good company. See how the share of social increased right before going to bed. In reality partying was mostly late-night conversations with fellow students about life, studies and stuff. Other than that Night guy of 2023 has been studying and chilling before sleep, much like the younger version of himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, we have seen WHAT were these 2 guys doing. Now about WHEN they were doing it. The plot below shows percentage of wake up (left) and bedtime (right) times for 2 periods. It is clear that going to bed earlier is (at least visually) associated with earlier wake-up time.\nWould be curious to look into a how variation in bedtime affect the variation in wake-up time. Notice how in 2023 wake-up times are heavily centered around 08:00, while bedtime is all over the place from 00:00 to 04:00! And the opposite for 2020, bedtime is centered around 00:00, and wake-up time has a bigger spread from as early as 04:00 to 10:00."

That sea of blue at the bottom is Sleep, a swarm of golden dots right above is breakfast (Food), and above are other daily activities. You are looking at my 2020.\n2019-2020 was my sophomore year at university, where I (should) have studied entrepreneurial studies. But majority of my time was preoccupied with extracurricular activities, mainly, studying Japanese.\nI’ve found out about time-tracking and decided to give it a try. Some thought were given to the number of categories (what to track) and the frequency of tracking (how to track). With 13 categories that sufficiently capture my life and 72 20-minute intervals I was set up to track some time."

While I appreciate the premise of the quote and it’s catchy, motivating nature, it is false and I know just by how much!\nMy younger self was easily swayed by such simple and inspiring quotes, they made me wanna get out there and do great things! When I started time tracking, I set goals on how much hours I wanted to spend per each category. For example, I needed to spend 1000 hours learning Japanese by December 2020, clock at least 5 hours/week of Sports to stay fit, accumulate no less than 10 hours/week of socializing before I go crazy.\nAfter a couple of weeks I was behind on many of my goals. Upon closer inspection I realized that I failed to account for sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t even have 16 hours in a day\nYes! Not only sleep was taking too much time, but also miscellaneous—an umbrella category for non-productive, but necessary parts of life. Brushing teeth and taking a shower, doing groceries and laundry, cleaning a room and ironing a shirt, doing a medical check-up, waiting in a queue (!) are some of the activities that happen daily and there are no escaping them. Watching YouTube, reading social media and other such activities were not given a category of their own, they, too, fall under miscellaneous1.1 Aster Hu’s blog on tracking of spare time has a great descriptions of what comprises this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no structure to it, it is chaotic and permeates every day. So much of my 2020 was occupied with miscellaneous things it is scary—almost 6 hours of my day went towards this category! I didn’t think I spent too much time on social media and YouTube, but looking back I absolutely did!\nTime is not found, it is made\nIf you considering learning a new skill, be ready to sacrifice the time needed to learn this skill from some other activity you’ve been doing.\nIn my case, I’ve sacrificed my  university studies to acquire Japanese.\nIn Ukraine an emergency lockdown was declared on March 20, 2020. Interestingly how with it my diligent studying ended—average hours spent studying never came back to pre-pandemic level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, Covid played a role—suddenly there was no need to commute to and fro university, be present and active during online classes—but I’ve already been steadily increasing my time with the target language. By that time I’ve already obtained N4 (A2) and knew that to reach N3 and above (B1+), much more hours had to be spent with the language. For Japanese I needed at least 1000 hours to pass N3 in December 2020. To get these 1000 hours I have sacrificed my main studies in the university."

I could spend every waking hour working/studying, have food brought to me, replace social life with daily work meetings—what a wicked thought—and never see the light of day! But what a miserable life that would be!\nLooking back, I could have spent less time scrolling feed in the morning and before bed, watching videos after school, and instead spend more time with friends and family, doing sports and studying Japanese."

For example, if you dream about running a marathon you have to hit the track and run, and run a lot. Your colleague tells you about this marathon in 5 months and you decide to finally make your dream come true and sign up. So far, you’ve been running sub-5k runs every once in a while and a marathon seems daunting. How do you plan your next runs so that when the day comes you finish the run?\nYou can think in terms of mileage\n\nX km/week and increase this number each week until you reach the marathon week\n\nor in terms of your best runs, which is a variation of the above.\nOr, you can think in terms of hours! Essentially it is the same, but from different perspective. Tracking hours really puts your goals in direct comparison with other parts of your life and you can easily spot things that prevent you from achieving your goals—if this is the case. Time tracking takes focus from something far and sometimes unreachable to something you have full control over—your time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession info\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\nRunning under: Windows 11 x64 (build 22631)\n\nMatrix products: default\n\n\nlocale:\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8 \n[2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8   \n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n[4] LC_NUMERIC=C                          \n[5] LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n\ntime zone: Europe/Kiev\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] grid      stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods  \n[8] base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] patchwork_1.2.0    DT_0.33            RColorBrewer_1.1-3 fontawesome_0.5.2 \n [5] knitr_1.46         glue_1.7.0         ggiraph_0.8.10     scales_1.3.0      \n [9] plotly_4.10.4      reshape2_1.4.4     transformr_0.1.5   showtext_0.9-7    \n[13] showtextdb_3.0     sysfonts_0.8.9     ggthemes_5.1.0     ggtext_0.1.2      \n[17] ggExtra_0.10.1     zoo_1.8-12         lubridate_1.9.3    forcats_1.0.0     \n[21] stringr_1.5.1      dplyr_1.1.4        purrr_1.0.2        readr_2.1.5       \n[25] tidyr_1.3.1        tibble_3.2.1       ggplot2_3.5.1      tidyverse_2.0.0   \n[29] stargazer_5.2.3   \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] tidyselect_1.2.1   viridisLite_0.4.2  farver_2.1.2       fastmap_1.2.0     \n [5] lazyeval_0.2.2     tweenr_2.0.3       promises_1.3.0     digest_0.6.35     \n [9] timechange_0.3.0   mime_0.12          lifecycle_1.0.4    sf_1.0-16         \n[13] magrittr_2.0.3     compiler_4.3.0     sass_0.4.9         rlang_1.1.3       \n[17] tools_4.3.0        utf8_1.2.4         yaml_2.3.8         data.table_1.15.4 \n[21] htmlwidgets_1.6.4  classInt_0.4-10    curl_5.2.1         plyr_1.8.9        \n[25] xml2_1.3.6         KernSmooth_2.23-20 miniUI_0.1.1.1     withr_3.0.0       \n[29] fansi_1.0.6        xtable_1.8-4       e1071_1.7-14       colorspace_2.1-0  \n[33] cli_3.6.2          rmarkdown_2.27     generics_0.1.3     rstudioapi_0.16.0 \n[37] httr_1.4.7         tzdb_0.4.0         cachem_1.1.0       DBI_1.2.2         \n[41] proxy_0.4-27       vctrs_0.6.5        jsonlite_1.8.8     hms_1.1.3         \n[45] crosstalk_1.2.1    systemfonts_1.1.0  jquerylib_0.1.4    units_0.8-5       \n[49] stringi_1.8.4      gtable_0.3.5       later_1.3.2        munsell_0.5.1     \n[53] pillar_1.9.0       htmltools_0.5.8.1  R6_2.5.1           lpSolve_5.6.20    \n[57] evaluate_0.23      shiny_1.8.1.1      lattice_0.21-8     gridtext_0.1.5    \n[61] bslib_0.7.0        httpuv_1.6.15      class_7.3-21       Rcpp_1.0.12       \n[65] uuid_1.2-0         xfun_0.44          pkgconfig_2.0.3"

This view is prevalent among Ukrainians, who are on paper the most educated population in Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have missed two years of student life due to covid, which could be the reason we have bonded this much.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the very first days there was a difference. Students actually wanted to study.\n\n\n\n\nSo much so that we studied despite the power outages. We’d sit in the school’s basement. This would be fixed\n\n\n\n\nAnd study on campus sometimes deep into the night.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the first semester I was happy to have survived. I have failed one class and had to retake it next year.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary marked the start of the hardest period thus far with more advanced courses. Whereas before I saw studying as a good thing to do. Now I saw that I can actually achieve smth.\n\n\n\n\nThis intensity took it’s toll as taking a nap a frequent occurrence. I wasn’t the only one affected.\n\n\n\n\nThere was no time to sleep, as our university had many guests come visit and talk to students. Sanna Marin, Ulf Kristensson, Mark Rutte \n\n\n\n\nI started looking for an internship as early as April. We had more studies in May-June.\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate test of one’s knowledge is getting a job. For me it came naturally, many of my peers and many more in other universities have to work in addition to studying. Stipend if you manage to get one is so meager, you can’t live off of it.\n\n\n\n\nI got a job as a junior researcher at Institute for Behavioral Studies. I would be working with prof. that initially sparked my interest in behavioral economics!\n\n\n\n\nLife as it is right now is very uncertain and one out to be prepared. In 2022 I have attended millitary training courses at my hometown, now, having more time I took an intensive military course.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we are on the topic. It’s true that for many men getting a degree became a chance to buy time (student’s are exempt from draft). \n\n\n\n\nI took writing thesis seriously and have read extensively.\n\n\n\n\nAdded pressure was from having to retake calculus from last year. \n\n\n\n\nAll this yellow in the middle! Somebody was hurrying to finish by November 1st!\n\n\n\n\nAnd I did!\n\n\n\n\nLast step was thesis defence after which I became master"

    "text": "Story\nI have grown knowing that you go to university to get a paper and then “at the job” you’ll be taught how to work. This view is prevalent among Ukrainians, who are on paper the most educated population in Europe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have missed two years of student life due to covid, which could be the reason we have bonded this much.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the very first days there was a difference. Students actually wanted to study.\n\n\n\n\nSo much so that we studied despite the power outages. We’d sit in the school’s basement. This would be fixed\n\n\n\n\nAnd study on campus sometimes deep into the night.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the first semester I was happy to have survived. I have failed one class and had to retake it next year.\n\n\n\n\nJanuary marked the start of the hardest period thus far with more advanced courses. Whereas before I saw studying as a good thing to do. Now I saw that I can actually achieve smth.\n\n\n\n\nThis intensity took it’s toll as taking a nap a frequent occurrence. I wasn’t the only one affected.\n\n\n\n\nThere was no time to sleep, as our university had many guests come visit and talk to students. Sanna Marin, Ulf Kristensson, Mark Rutte \n\n\n\n\nI started looking for an internship as early as April. We had more studies in May-June.\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate test of one’s knowledge is getting a job. For me it came naturally, many of my peers and many more in other universities have to work in addition to studying. Stipend if you manage to get one is so meager, you can’t live off of it.\n\n\n\n\nI got a job as a junior researcher at Institute for Behavioral Studies. I would be working with prof. that initially sparked my interest in behavioral economics!\n\n\n\n\nLife as it is right now is very uncertain and one out to be prepared. In 2022 I have attended millitary training courses at my hometown, now, having more time I took an intensive military course.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we are on the topic. It’s true that for many men getting a degree became a chance to buy time (student’s are exempt from draft). \n\n\n\n\nI took writing thesis seriously and have read extensively.\n\n\n\n\nAdded pressure was from having to retake calculus from last year. \n\n\n\n\nAll this yellow in the middle! Somebody was hurrying to finish by November 1st!\n\n\n\n\nAnd I did!\n\n\n\n\nLast step was thesis defence after which I became master"

    "text": "library(rolldown)\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years I have received some advise that has been poisoning my mind ever since.\n“When you go to university, don’t think you’ll learn anything useful. When you go to work, then you’ll learn how things really work.”\nWith this sound advice I moved to the capital to study managerial studies at Kyiv National Economics University, fortunate enough to secure a budget place. As a rather naive young man, I took that advice to heart. From the very beginning, I threw myself into the university experience—not just the academics, but the cultural and educational activities, both within the university and beyond. I became a class representative and an active member of the student council, immersing myself in what felt like the full spectrum of university life.\nI had taken that advice to heart: “You won’t learn anything useful at university.” And, in many ways, it turned out to be true. My days were consumed by completing assignments, printing lab reports, and submitting tasks just to check boxes, rather than engaging in meaningful learning or truly understanding the material. Studying became a mechanical process, devoid of curiosity or purpose. Then came COVID, and later the war, and I found myself exactly where I had been four years ago—lost, unprepared, and facing the stark reality that I had absorbed little of practical use. I was forced to start over and rethink everything I believed about education.\nThis story is not just about earning a master’s degree. It is the story of unlearning old habits and mindsets, embracing a new way of studying, and discovering what education truly means and what it should aspire to be.\n@cr-guide\nFrom October 2022 to January 2024 I’ve been tracking how I spend my time. At the end of each day—or sometimes during breaks or while commuting—I would open Excel and log what I had been up to in the preceding hours. And in the preceding hours I’d usually study. This included attending classes, working on assignments, doing group projects, online courses and workshops. @cr-guide-study\nEvenings were often filled with lively conversations with friends about life, dreams, and the occasional heated debate over coursework. I’d spend time with fellow students doing homework together, sharing meals, or simply unwinding after a long day. Beyond my university circle, I had my own tight-knit group of friends who became a vital part of my life at the time. @cr-guide-social\nAs the intensity of studying died down, I began exploring job opportunities, attending interviews, and eventually landing a position in the summer 2023. @cr-guide-work\nOf course, life wasn’t all about studying, working, and socializing. It took time to get to all of those things. Not forgetting to eat in between. In my downtime, I found moments to breathe. Sometimes I’d pick up a book and escape into its pages for a while. And then there was everything in between—chores, shopping, running errands, or just relaxing after a long day. @cr-guide-rest\n@cr-guide-sleep And then there was sleep—or more often, the lack of it. My sleeping schedule was anything but regular. There were stretches when I’d go to bed near 2 a.m. every single night for two weeks, pushing through exhaustion as if rest were optional. It wasn’t always healthy, but it was undeniably part of the student experience."

    "text": "Making Up for Lost Years\nCovid started it and war finished it. Offline education as it was prior to 2020, became a thing of the past. During the first two years of my undergraduate studies at KNEU, I spent time with my group mates—talking about life, hanging out between classes. Then classes went online, students home and social life out of the window.\nEven when we did meet up in person, our ranks had thinned. By 2020 and 2021, it wasn’t the same anymore. Some students started working full-time, others returned to their hometowns, and the once-familiar faces became fewer and farther between.\nTo be honest, back then, I didn’t mind. I was happy not having to show my face in a classroom every day. Passing courses felt easier, too—if you know what I mean. But after those two years of isolation, compounded by the early months of the full-scale invasion, I realized just how much I missed that part of student life. The pent-up energy from those years of seclusion had to go somewhere.\nWhen I got into my master’s program at KSE, it was clear I wasn’t alone in feeling this way. Our new cohort was so eager to study together, to be together, and to make up for those two lost years.\n@cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost\nFrom the first days we’d gather on campus to listen to online lectures and do HWs together. University was our safe heaven.\nIt wasn’t all fun and games. People here were extremely hardworking and did their best to understand the material. Despite many having a part-time job in addition to their studies everyone busted their ass and worked hard. The sight of student falling asleep from exhaustion was unimaginable but here this was usual.\n@cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost\nThere were power outages and air alerts. We were required to leave classrooms and move to the shelter in the basement. On some days we had power outages. We’d study in the basement with no lights. Our institution was doing it’s best to provide studying facilities and we reciprocated by doing our best. @cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost\nSome days we’d stay at the staff to let us sleep over at the premises. Deadlines kept us working until midnight, and after that, it was board games and quiet conversations until morning. What our group understood is that studying is also about community building, the people who study with you. @cr-timeline-lost\n@cr-timeline-lost \n@cr-timeline-lost"

    "text": "Reality check\nMy first semester during undergrad I had a philosophy class that went over my head. I attended lectures and seminars, did weekly homework. But there was so much ground to cover, and my shallow understanding wasn’t enough. I went to the exam, where I got a ticket with questions I had no answers to. Sitting there in a class packed with students, looking at the sheet of paper, I heard the whisper from inside “you’re screwed”. A quick glance to my sides revealed the play I’d unwittingly become part of—a play that would repeat itself many times over and one I’d eventually participate in myself. One side tried very hard to look for and not find cheating, and another to not cheat while cheating.\nI got an abysmal and ego-bruising 9 out of 100, which sent me, along with three other ‘backward’ students, to a retake it in a week. That week was stressful and I did my best to prepare. On retake day, the four of us sat in a nearly empty classroom. I wrote what I could and passed—not without help of a student who came more prepared than me—they sneaked me a much needed shpora. As I turned in my answers I got a stern look from professor and an admonition “to think what I do with my life.”\nI wasn’t the brightest, but I took classes seriously. that I could memorize and understand everything we were taught. But that first semester taught me something else: being serious wasn’t enough. Seeing those who cheat get ahead, and those who don’t study at all somehow stay in the pack made me wonder what am I doing there.\nAt the time it was convenient to put the blame on professors. Boring, uninteresting, teaching obsolete things, not practical… there was plenty of professors who just went through the motions and didn’t care about students. Some genuinely wanted us to learn and succeed. I experienced this firsthand when one professor went out of their way to help me pass a difficult course. But by doing so he did me a bear’s service. As It looked like professors were encouraged to keep students and not fail them. And thusly, we learned that there are no consequences to failing. You always had a second, even a third chance. To ease the first chance it wasn’t uncommon for teacher during exams to leave the room to ‘get a coffee’. Strangely, I sometimes wished they had failed me, forced me to face the music earlier. Maybe then I would have learned what it really means to study and grow up.\nMaybe this is a game, those are the rules. And I learned to play the game. Once I have figured it’d be easier to fail a class, because retaking was much easier. I’d ignore it and then at the end of semester a teacher would give me an opportunity to make-up with a massive test, which you cannot fail, or do a favor of translating an article, or preparing a presentation. Hours of studying saved—that was a win in my book.\nWhen finally during the second year appeared one visiting professor who challenged the status quo. He wanted us to work and learn. He’d spent extra hours with students to make sure they understood the material. He’d bombard us with homework and would actually check if you did the job. For his efforts he got resentment and displeasure of the whole group. There was nothing he could do with this culture of impunity. Studying has turned into submitting tasks. And had little to do with learning. We were taught, but we didn’t truly learn.\nLooking back, I see how wrong I was about what studying is. It’s hard. It’s not supposed to be easy. You’re meant to fail, to wrestle with problems, to struggle until you find a solution—not memorize the answer and forget it the next day. Studying is about thinking critically, questioning your understanding, and challenging yourself. None of this is trivial. For me, the realization came almost too late.\n@cr-timeline-reality\nMy best was not enough to pass all the courses. I had failed one calculus course, averaging a meager 70. A mark, a year before, I had to lift my finger to get, I had to sweat for to get. There were no retakes, I fail and had to retake the course in a year. If before I could juggle 2 F, now they’d get me expelled. And the threat was real. Students were expelled, their results annulled.\nStudent’s attitude was different, too. Despite us complaining about some professors, everyone understood that it is their responsibility to learn. No shifting the blame on professors or anyone for that matter—if you’ve failed it was you.\nHere, the rules weren’t just different—they were enforced. Breaking them had consequences, real ones. And while I had been fine skirting the rules before, watching others struggle, problem-solve, and genuinely try to learn made me start to change too.\nJanuary marked the start of the hardest period thus far with more advanced courses. From day one I struggled to keep up and would sit deep into the night to read up on the material. @cr-timeline-reality\nThis intensity took it’s toll as taking a nap became a frequent occurrence. Many had burnouts. @cr-timeline-reality\n @cr-timeline-reality\nWhat is worse, there was no time to sleep, as our university had many guests come visit and talk to students. Sanna Marin, Ulf Kristensson, Mark Rutte to name a few. What they achieved is much needed morale boost and we trudged on. @cr-timeline-reality\nFebruary, March, now April. Studying continued as usual. New courses, new challenges, some fun, some bloody difficult. I got used to intensity and have pretty much caught up with the rest. My grades improved.\n@cr-timeline-lost\nThe ultimate test of one’s knowledge is getting a job. I have applied to multiple positions, some found me, but I’ve chosen the one that wanted most. Starting August 2023 I’d be working in the Institute for Behavioral Studies as a junior researcher. @cr-timeline-reality\n@cr-timeline-reality"

But there in the moment while you’re really struggling to with your HW, guys your age put their life on the line. It’s not that whatever it is you are working on is not hard, but compared to them it is nothing. You can start tomorrow, for some of them there is no tomorrow. And you feel miserable. You think you’re simply wasting your time.\nFurther devaluing studying is how it became a gateway for people to dodge draft, buy time or otherwise safeguard themselves from the army. Some consider it “…a better option compared to paying thousands of dollars and escaping”.\nNews come in of further advances and shortage of personnel. You just dive in the textbook and push the thoughts away. Two emotions went hand in hand. Guilt that my seemingly peaceful existence is sheltered by the bodies of my peers. And fear. These emotions made me do my best to apply myself at studying and research. And I did, meanwhile preparing for when I have to take up arms.\n@cr-timeline-war\nIn summer 2023 I’ve enrolled in a military training program for civilians. We’d train each weekend for 4 weeks and have lectures during the week. We were trained in weapons handling, tactical medicine (MARCH), orientation and @cr-timeline-war\n …digging trenches. @cr-timeline-war\nThere were a few young men, my age, most were older and expected to be drafted sooner or later. For them this course is a stepping stone to a place in a better regiment, an opportunity to learn as much as possible before deployment. They had no illusions of a gamble one took in going anywhere, they took matters in their own hands. When they are there they’d know a thing or two and would teach it to their comrades. @cr-timeline-war\n Collective responsibility @cr-timeline-war\nTraining ended with a simulation, where we had to dig in and defend a choke point in the forest, while advanced group assaulted our positions.

    "text": "Just a Paper\nThesis. The most dreadful word for a student. It’s the final hurdle standing in the way of many students and their degree. Rarely have I found a student that enjoyed working on their thesis paper or liked doing research for that matter. For most, it’s just something to get over with—another assignment that feels like it adds no real value.\nNot everyone sees the point of putting effort into a thesis, and not everyone plans to get a PhD. Many students from top institutions aim for industry jobs where their skills can earn them high salaries and stable careers. Academia, by comparison, offers little in the way of tangible rewards.\nEven so, I believe universities should encourage students to take their theses more seriously. A thesis isn’t just another box to tick—it’s a testing ground for everything a student has learned. It’s an opportunity to show what they’re capable of. A well-written thesis on a topic that interests the student can be a strong selling point. It’s evidence of prior work and expertise that can make a difference when competing for high-paying jobs.\nFor me, the idea of doing research was appealing from the start. I think it is my masochistic nature. This ‘nature’ not only cost me hundreds of excruciating hours writing and rewriting, but even after it was done it was a source of brain damage.\nGetting a lower grade in a difficult course is one thing, but hearing someone casually claim they wrote their thesis in under a week? That’s a whole new level of demoralizing. Sure, prior knowledge and the complexity of the topic matter, but still. My thesis took me no less than five months of relentless effort. 2 months to set up a prior experiment to test the initial hypotheses, then another month of extensive literature review and refinement of hypothesis; then 3 more months to finalize the survey, analyse the data and write the damn thing.\nA week, you say? My ass!\n@cr-timeline-paper\n@cr-timeline-paper\nI was writing a thesis about the impact of war on people’s choices with brilliant advisers—Tymofiy Brik, Volodymyr Vakhitov, and Nataly Zaika. The idea for the paper came from an observation: certain decisions seemed to be put off because of the war. Depending on how someone perceives their circumstances, their reactions—and by extension, their decisions—can vary dramatically. To buy or keep renting? To save or spend? @cr-timeline-paper\nIn August-October I’d regularly discuss progress with my thesis advisers. Whether online or in-person, these sessions were invaluable. I’d present my challenges, share my questions, and they’d offer thoughtful advice to help me move forward. @cr-timeline-paper\nI’d always believed I was naturally good at writing. In my head, I could craft complex arguments, using elegant language to tie everything together. But the moment I tried to put those thoughts on paper, the illusion shattered. The last two weeks before submission were particularly brutal. I wasn’t naturally good at this, and it showed. I wrote and rewrote the results section over and over, trying to piece it together in a coherent way. It was grueling and exhausting. @cr-timeline-paper\nAnd, of course, life didn’t stop while I worked on my thesis. I had a job and multiple projects to juggle. In the closing minutes of October I’ve at last, after a week-long marathon, submitted my thesis. I was proud, but more so relieved.\nIn the month between submission and defense, I retook the courses I’d failed the year before and worked longer hours. But preparing for the defense loomed over everything. Writing a thesis is a miserable experience: you feel incompetent every step of the way—until defense day, when you have to convince a committee that you’re not. When my time came, I stood before the committee, half an hour later I was done. @cr-timeline-paper\n Fast forward to July 2024, when we got official ceremony. I finally got my paper.\n@cr-timeline-paper"

After all, every society needs competent and ethical leaders—in government, in businesses, and in our daily lives. Leaders who know how to work hard and who are willing to help others succeed.\nBut even the strongest university culture can only do so much. Ultimately, it’s up to the student to seize the opportunity, to go beyond what is asked, and to truly engage with their learning. Too often, cheating and shortcuts overshadow genuine effort. Yet, I believe this can change.\nThere is a future for Ukrainian students. Good universities and programs exist, and while private institutions lead the way for now, several national universities are stepping up as well. With the right guidance, strong values, and a commitment to nurturing both intellect and character, these institutions can help students not only succeed academically but also shape a better society.\nAs I look back on my journey, I realize how fortunate I’ve been to meet brilliant people who studied beside me. Their dedication, intellect, and integrity are a testament to what good education can foster. To my teachers and friends, I say:\n\nYou’ve made a human out of me."
