    "text": "Toastmasters in a Nutshell\n*For people who hear about Toastmasters for the first time.** This is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:\n\nPrepared speeches session: usually 5-7 mins long given by Club members;\nTable Topics (TT) session: 2 mins impromptu speeches (everyone can participate), one can volunteer to answer a question or will be chosen by a toastmaster;\nEvaluation session: everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.\n\nToastmasters are more organized and formal compared to many speaking clubs. Many of its members are middle-aged with higher education. These people value their time and that is why among the evaluators there is a Timer (Ta-da!). Timer’s responsibility is to keep track of time and show colored signs to a speaker. Without going into much detail,  green  is an early warning,  yellow  - soon the time will be up,  red  - time is up, finish your speech. Timer also tracks the time of each speaker and presents the Timer Report - sine qua non2 of this article.2 A necessary condition without which something is not possible [from Latin]"

    "text": "Note on Timer reports\nTimer tracks everyone’s time, as can be seen on the reports. Here we will be only looking at Table Topics (TT) session times. Reports usually have the following information useful for our analysis:\n\nSpeaker Name\nSpeech Time\nClub\nDate\nTT winner4\n\n\n4 There are many reports that don’t include TT winner or times of some speakers. Some speaker volunteer two or more times, which complicates analysis.I have looked at too much timer reports (see examples by clicking on each Tab). It is as boring as being a Timer - manual work, under-appreciated and no one really cares. However, I was delighted to come across some very fine reports - a bright spark in otherwise gloom sea of boringness. These people turned a mundane, just-get-it-over-with role and created something worthwhile - a memory. For a lurking, opportunistic Toastmasters anthropologist (author) that is for sure.\nBut by and large, reports are nothing special. Some people have created a nice Excel sheet to track the time, others write on piece of paper.\nI sense that some of you keen readers might have a suspicion that the author is a little crazy - going through hundreds of reports himself! Yes, he is; and while you hold that thought, hear this: some timer went to the trouble of writing down time to milliseconds (!), yet another specimen had written a start time (to milliseconds of course) and end time and subtracted the two to get a total time. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! You think I’m crazy?\nBut without these crazy reports, I wouldn’t have went through with this article.\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n13"

The difference is not significant! The distributions closely resemble each other. Women don’t speak longer than men!\nWomen actually speak a little less than men. However we cannot say that women ACTUALLY talk less! In the current study we only observe time taken to speak, however within these 2 minutes on stage, they might talk more (on average) than men. There seem to be report that women communicate ideas differently and use more words like ah/uh/m-m-m/you know/so/like7.7 Foreshadowing a future ah-counter perspective on winning TT?!\nStrangely enough, if the proportion of men in TT session increases - then TT session will be be shorter. Also, having more men speak during TT session is associated with lower TT times."

    "text": "Do we speak longer online?\nIn-person conversations/presentation have you deal with people - you see/hear/feel/smell them every second of your speech. There are so many signals communicated non-verbally that we don’t even notice them. During in-person meetings when you take too long to finish people start fidgeting, yawning, looking away, and you know you don’t want to make them uncomfortable so you quickly wrap up your speech. Online you deal with avatars, the only means of communication with them (your audience) is by observing their reaction. Perhaps this makes you go overtime more often than you would’ve had you given a particular speech in person. We test this below:\n\n\nOnline/Offline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Online/Offline\n\n\n\nRegression results\n====================================================\n                    Time               tt_time      \n                     (1)                 (2)        \n----------------------------------------------------\nON_OFF              0.580            -178.118***    \n                   (1.916)            (26.812)      \nObservations        1,432               1,432       \nR2                  0.000               0.030       \nAdjusted R2        -0.001               0.029       \n----------------------------------------------------\nNotes:       ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n             **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n             *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\nWhether the meeting is online or offline has no effect on speech lengths, however there is a strong association with total TT session time: on average online TT sessions are longer than in-person ones by 160 secs (~1.5 speakers). One possible explanation for this is the fact that one doesn’t have to go home after the meeting, working from home and joining the meeting without spending hours commuting enables all participants to answer a question during TT.\n\n\nIndividual Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTT Session Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Year\n\n\n\nRegression results\n====================================================\n                    Time               tt_time      \n                     (1)                 (2)        \n----------------------------------------------------\nYear2012          34.977**            -130.545      \n                  (16.572)            (217.757)     \nYear2013          32.583**            -100.583      \n                  (16.279)            (213.902)     \nYear2016          45.750***            43.500       \n                  (16.918)            (222.294)     \nYear2017           36.850*             -1.000       \n                  (20.332)            (267.164)     \nYear2018          42.788***            73.423       \n                  (14.420)            (189.472)     \nYear2019          39.441***           321.941*      \n                  (13.331)            (175.163)     \nYear2020          43.136***           402.828**     \n                  (12.794)            (168.107)     \nYear2021          44.867***          467.536***     \n                  (12.719)            (167.132)     \nYear2022          46.424***          750.497***     \n                  (12.699)            (166.861)     \nConstant          61.750***          494.000***     \n                  (12.610)            (165.688)     \nObservations        1,432               1,432       \nR2                  0.013               0.155       \nAdjusted R2         0.006               0.150       \n----------------------------------------------------\nNotes:       ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n             **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n             *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\nWhile the distribution of individual speeches remains “Normal” throughout the years, TT sessions became longer and take up to 40(!) minutes."

You are not given their attention indefinitely, you have to use this opportunity exhaustively making every second count. Speak fast and blurt out your thought and they will not understand it fully. Speak too much and they switch off and feel like you can’t properly articulate your thoughts. You have to finish by the time they lose focus!"
