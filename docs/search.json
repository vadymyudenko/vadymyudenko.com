    "text": "A woman of 70. Born 200 km away from Moscow, she came to Ukraine with her husband and their small child in 1976 as they got a job at a car works. She looked after the kid and husband was providing for the family. In ten years, the Soviet Union collapsed and their life… didn’t change much. Her husband was still an engineer and she took an accountant position at a local military unit. In the late nineties their firstborn went to study in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, before coming home and settling. Nothing changed in the next ten years, the Orange Revolution, the 2008 crisis went past them. All the while they kept close ties with their family back in Russia. Visiting each other once a year or two. Sending family photos, letters and post cards.\nThen came the annexation of Crimea and occupation of Donbas, but conversations didn’t change much, only visiting each other was harder because of increased border checks. Life continued as normal until the 24th of February, 2022. On THE DAY there was no call, week passed by — still nothing. So she took initiative and gave them a call.\n“Aлло”, familiar voice answers the phone. “How are you?” “Good and you?” “Okay…”, they exchange a few civilities until the woman can’t contain herself anymore. She is not okay! She told about how russian soldiers are bombing our cities, about the sirens and the mall. They were not impressed and, as all respectable followers of the word of putin, repeated what their TV-scriptures say word for word. Denazification, Banderovites, “we don’t bomb civilians”, “those are fakes”… Her attempts to speak sense into them were futile. Distressed, she says goodbye and as she hangs the phone, it echoes…\n\n“…We all love you, and so does Putin” (Ми все вас любим, и Путин тоже)\n\n\nUkrainians now have a terrible time speaking with relatives in russia. Having to prove the REALITY of our suffering is infuriating. HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE NOT TRUE?! WHAT IS MORE REAL THAN PAIN? But these are the questions you unconsciously ask yourself after conversations with your, now very distant, relatives. One intercepted call that terrified me was of a Ukrainian woman calling her male relative, a militant of the so-called DNR, whose unit then/is still stationed in Kherson region.\nW: You explained to me about Banderites, I believed you. I hated them. Now, who should I hate? … Why are they like this, Seryozha? What are they raping children for? What is this?\nM: Who told you? Do you know this for sure? Or are these just rumors?\nW: I know for sure. *crying* I’m not telling anything more.\n\nYou can most certainly feel despair in her voice, when the man questions the REALITY of her experience. This conversation is emblematic of conversations Ukrainians have with their RU relatives. Any appeals to reason are met with ready-made answers (NATO, nazis, biolabs), facts are met with “fakes!” and emotions with “understanding and love”. After all they consider us their brothers…at least used to.\nUkrainians and russians are not brothers. For centuries Ukraine has been under Moscow’s rule. In Soviet times, especially, all things Ukrainian were persecuted. Horrible atrocities were committed to bring (not only) Ukrainian population under control — Holodomor, Dekulakization, Executed Renaissance. Those who weren’t killed, were sent to Siberia, spared lived under constant threat of being next.\nUsing wrong words or criticizing the official line was unacceptable. Despite that, there was freedom of speech in the Soviet Union, but no freedom after speech. Snitching on one’s neighbor was prevalent, so people learned to keep to themselves and live in silence. Now, in putinist russia narratives of decaying West, strong and mighty russia and of foreign agents reiterate those of Soviet era. And snitching is coming back.\n\nFear of punishment is not the only factor preventing relatives in russia from speaking out and protesting. Understanding that nothing is going to change, I-am-just-a-small-person mentality are also on the list. But the main reason is hands down — russian propaganda.\nIn a carefully constructed putinist worldview there is no room for logic and reason. It’s a constant stream of repetitive, often contradictory narratives, multiplied and spread in big volumes. This propaganda boils down to 2 things. 1st is that without putin russia can’t do. And 2nd — all the rest are wretched and corrupt (especially the West and America). The later is best exemplified in Navalny’s investigation of International Sawmill show (HERE, first 10 mins, has funny captions), where foreign leaders are made fun of and putin is the boss. All other things russian propaganda can sell to its audience. Look no further then “the gesture of goodwill” by russian army from Snake Island and negative emersion of Moskva flagship. Blasting people with conspiracy theories and half-baked news, at a rate they can’t keep up with, earned it a name — Firehose of Falsehood. And not only russians are susceptible to it.\nMany Ukrainians also fell victims to the propaganda and still believe in what it spews. One close friend of mine recounts conversations with their relatives who, after 24th of February, stayed in Kharkiv, in the city’s most shelled area — Northern Saltivka. There, under constant shelling, they continued to believe in the brave new russian world.\nLike any functioning society Ukraine has issues and problems. There are people who don’t need propaganda to be anti-ua and pro-ru and they have their reasons. Again, Ukraine has many problems we, Ukrainians, must solve. Nazis and rusophobia — two main justifications for full-scale war on Ukraine — are not them. Those who say otherwise are delusional, they’ve lost touch with reality and play into the hands of invaders. Of course, there are people who take a more radical stance on issues, just like everywhere in the world, but they are a minuscule minority, who have little to no effect on the country’s agenda. If you have a relative or a colleague who believes in persecution of all things russian before 2014, ask them why has russia invaded and razed to the ground the most pro-russian regions and cities? Plant the seed of doubt in their infertile soil.\nIn the 50 years that my grandma has been in Ukraine no one has said a word about her nationality (кацапка), her mother tongue, no one forced her to learn and speak Ukrainian. Yet, this is what our relatives in russia and some simple-minded compatriots are led to believe.\nGrandma is 71 now. Sitting on her armchair in the empty living room, she turns on TV to watch russian channels — old habits die hard. She still carries her cellphone in case THEY call, although she admits there is nothing to talk about anymore. On the table next to the remote there is a crossword magazine in Ukrainian — it’s hard, but she is trying. She is russian, was and will be, but above all things, she wants her grandchildren to be Ukrainian. To live in a free and peaceful country, to find their way, to marry (soon, grandma) and lead a fulfilling life.\n2 months into the war she, whose mother tongue is russian, who never learned Ukrainian, who was never forced to learn it and forget russian, wished me a happy birthday in Nightingalian*.\n*Ukrainians refer to Ukrainian as Nightingalian (Солов’їна)"

    "text": "On June 27th I was dinning out when at 15:44 sirens echoed through the downtown. Again… we had a siren just an hour ago… I think to myself waiting for my order. People around seemed not to notice a siren at all. A family of 4, probably well-off refugees from Kharkiv, immersing themselves in a friendly chatter, business lady in front struggling with a new QR-code menu and teenage girls snickering behind… what siren? Oh! You mean this annoying distracting sound? Well, we pretend not to notice it, we filter out, WE DON’T LISTEN. It is normal… now.\nYesterday was 1 month since the heinous terroristic act shocked my hometown to the core. In Ukraine, as a custom, we commemorate those who fell victims to the crimes of russia at 9AM with a minute of silence…\nAt 15:51 was a BIG BOOM — building shook lightly. It took some seconds before we realized what happened. NOW WE WERE LISTENING. 2nd explosion followed and we leaving everything behind rushed to a basement. It must be the bridge, surely, a man was saying to gasps of people nearby.\nThere was no connection. Call to check on your parents — no signal. Viber, WhatsApp — nothing. I’m not staying here, I need to make sure they’re okay. As I leave the shelter — smoke was in the air. It must’ve been somewhere close. When I came to Amstor 30 mins after the strike the building was on fire. Hundreds of people treading on shattered glass to see what happened to the place — air alert was off — there was nothing to destroy anymore…\nThere were hundreds in there! What if they stayed… like me? I stood there feeling the gravity like never before. Eyes fixed on the fire.\nAs sickening as it sounds, luckily only 20 were lost in the airstrike with 58 injured. Some left when they heard a siren, small shop owners went on a coffee break, while many stayed… Hundreds of kilometers away from a frontline you don’t expect an air strike on a civilian object in the center of your city. You just don’t!\nIhad to leave town for two weeks on the day of the attack on the mall, when I came back, without seeing the place, I could sense it’s presence. It is the smell… that multiplies russian propaganda about alleged storage of NATO supplied ammunition by zero. The smell of death, sorrow and pain of every Kremenchuk citizen. The smell of rotting products — meat, fish, veggies and fruits. Mall housed many both small and big shops including a supermarket. Now hundreds of tons of products that haven’t melted in the fire rot away under the rubble. One month after the strike, the smell is still there.\nPeople walk past the empty shell throwing glances at what was the mall. When you’re in the city you don’t feel the smell anymore, it is when you leave and come back is when you are reminded of the horrors of 27th. With the airstrike came a grim realization that nowhere is safe (except a shelter). Living under constant threat is our new normal.\nSince the onset of war there was no doubt Kremenchuk would eventually be targeted. The city, industrial center of Poltava region, is a hometown to Ukrtatnafta oil refinery (the largest in Ukraine), Kremenchuk Carbon Black Plant (the largest producer of carbon black in Ukraine), Kryukiv Railway Car Building Works (one of the largest in Ukraine and of strategic importance), Kremenchuk Automobile Assembly Plant, Kremenchuk Wheel Plant and the bridge which is a key railway junction across Dnipro river.\nAfter living with sirens for one month, Kremenchuk had it’s first ‘прильот’ (air strike) on the2nd of April — oil refinery was hit. The following strikes kept on hitting only the oil refinery, gradually destroying the giant. Still, citizens felt relative safety as the strikes were outside the city. That is, until…\nMy family owns an office in the center by a maternity hospital some 600 meters away from Amstor. In the building we have an actual bomb shelter and throughout April — June it has seen little interest from public. The first wave was in the first days of war, then, over time, people became habituated to the sirens. They became a daily reminder of a war happening somewhere not in this world. Right after strikes on Ukrtatnafta more people decided not to trust their luck and come to the shelter, but only for a day or two. This is best captured by a local Telegram channels with pictures of cats as residents of Kremenchuk.\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbatim: denizens in the hall during air raid alert at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerbatim: denizens in the hall during air raid alert\n\n\n\n\nAmstor airstrike, horrific as it is, hasn’t and couldn’t have changed this trend. People can’t hide all the time, can’t always put life on hold… Except they do, seconds after another прильот, when the blast and shockwave tells you to run for dear life. Air strikes become a natural part of life… It is like on the morning radio they tell you a weather forecast… Dear citizens, today Kremenchuk is expecting a summery weather, comfy temperature and azure sky. Winds blow westward and the risk of ‘precipitation’ is PERMANENT. Have a great day, don’t ignore sirens and everything will be Ukraine!\n\n\n\nPeople gather around burning Amstor"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nConsider time as the invisible thread weaving through the fabric of every conversation, the silent drumbeat to which all effective communication must sync. It’s not just about being on time — though punctuality certainly speaks volumes — it’s also about respecting the rhythm of discourse, whether it’s a brief exchange or a lengthy dialogue.\nImagine the different scenarios: a toast at a family gathering, where brevity is laced with warmth; a debate, where each second is a battle for conviction; an elevator pitch, where within a minute, careers could be made or opportunities lost. While these situations differ wildly in content and context, one rule remains universally unchallenged: overrun your allotted time, and your message may fall on deaf ears — or worse, you might find yourself ‘toasted’!\nMoving beyond anecdotal evidence, we dive into the realm of data. To understand the practical implications of time (being in time, on time, overtime ) in communication, we’ve turned to a domain where time isn’t just a factor — it’s a contestant: the Toastmasters International meetings, specifically Table Topics session!\nIf you’re familiar with Toastmasters International, then jump straight to the results. If not - keep reading.\nToastmasters in a Nutshell\nToastmasters is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:\n\nPrepared speeches session: usually 5-7 minutes long speeches on various topics, these speeches are for members of the organization;\nTable Topics (TT) session: 2 minutes log impromptu speeches, everyone can participate, and the best speech is voted for;\nEvaluation session: everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.\n\nMost Toastmasters members are working professionals from different fields who want to network, be confident presenting, make new connections, and have a great time. Delivering prepared speeches allows members to structure their thoughts and practice their delivery. The Table Topics session, on the other hand, challenges members to speak impromptu. In this session, you can either volunteer to answer a question or be selected by the Table Topics Master. The essence of this activity is to encourage speaking “on your feet” rather than from the comfort of your seat.\nDuring the Evaluation session a Timer of the meeting - a person specifically assigned to the timetracking task - presents their report, sine qua non1 of this article. Timer’s responsibility is to keep track of time and indicate to the speakers how much time they have left before they have to wrap up. Without going into much detail, green is an early warning, yellow - soon the time will be up, red - time is up, finish your speech. At the end of the meeting a time has a report of speakers and their timings1 A necessary condition without which something is not possible [from Latin]"

    "text": "Data\nLike a famished mouse looking for breadcrumbs under the baker’s table, the author was open-sourcing these reports from Telegram , Facebook , some were written by author himself and other were transcribed from videos of the meetings.\nMost of the data was collected from Ukrainian TMCs: Chamber2, Arttalkers, Changemakers, Dniprohills, KOMA (UA-speaking) and Svoya Sorochka (UA-speaking). There are some reports from Japanese and Polish TMCs, but we will not be focusing on them.2 Special thanks goes to Chamber and their Timer reports, without them this project would’ve taken much-much longer.\n\n\nIn total there are 180 unique meetings in the dataset from 2018 till 2022. Some of the meetings were dropped due to NAs in at least one of the columns. Speaking of gender discrimination, there was none present, as the number of men and women3 is equal.\nThe gender of the speaker was assigned post hoc, based on the reports/photos of the meeting, common sense and a little bit of prejudice :)\nIn cases where it was impossible to establish the gender of a speaker - the whole meeting was excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\n# of TT paticipants\nProportion, %\n\n\n\nFemale\n682\n47.63\n\n\nMale\n700\n48.88\n\n\nNA\n50\n3.49\n\n\n\n\n\nWith regards to TT participant’s names there are a total of 312 unique names 4.\nIn reports the same people were reported under slightly different names. For example: Alexey/Aleksey/Alex/Oleksiy/Oleksey…. and their counterpart Cyrillic versions. To deal with this issue, all versions were renamed to Alex. Similar approach was taken with other names.\nAll Ukrainian names were translated to English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly we have Time of Table Topics (TT)! How TT works:\nYou have 2 minutes to answer a question or speak on the given topic. To stay within time limits, the timer will show you green sign when there is 1 minute left, yellow when 30 seconds and red when time is up.\nIdeally you want to have an opening-body-conclusion short speech, but this isn’t always possible. You can volunteer or be dragged on stage. The question may be familiar to you or something you haven’t even thought about. That is all to say, there are many different things happening during TT sessions and winning it requires achieving many things. At the end of TT everyone votes for “the best speech” - this is our dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion!\n\n\n\nBefore we get to figuring out what it takes to win TT, given the information above how does the distribution of TT times look like? A, B, C or D?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurprising? Either way, it is peculiar how these times fall into one of nature’s patterns!"

The difference is not significant! The distributions closely resemble each other. Women don’t speak longer than men!\nWomen actually speak a little less than men. However, we cannot say that women ACTUALLY talk less! In the current study we only observe time taken, but within these 2 minutes on stage, they might say more (on average) than men. There seem to be reports that women communicate ideas differently and use more words like ah/uh/m-m-m/you know/so/like5.5 Foreshadowing a future ah-counter perspective on winning TT?!\nStrangely enough, if the proportion of men in TT session increases - then TT session will be be shorter. Also, having more men speak during TT session is associated with lower TT times.\nDo we speak longer online?\nIn-person conversations and presentations require you to engage with people directly; you see, hear, feel, and even smell them throughout your speech. There are countless non-verbal signals that are communicated without us even noticing. During face-to-face meetings, if you take too long to finish, people may start fidgeting, yawning, or looking away. This indicates discomfort, prompting you to wrap up your speech quickly. In contrast, when interacting online, you are dealing with avatars, and the only means of gauging your audience’s reactions is by observing their responses. This may lead to a tendency to go overtime more often than if you were delivering the same speech in person. We will explore this further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Online/Offline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n======================================================\n                  Individual Time         TT Time     \n                        (1)                 (2)       \n------------------------------------------------------\nOnline/Offline         0.580            -178.118***   \n                      (1.916)            (26.812)     \nObservations           1,432               1,432      \nR2                     0.000               0.030      \nAdjusted R2           -0.001               0.029      \n------------------------------------------------------\nNotes:         ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n               **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n               *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhether the meeting is online or offline does not affect the length of TT speeches. However, there is a significant association with the total duration of TT sessions: on average, online TT sessions are longer than in-person ones by approximately 160 seconds (equivalent to about 1.5 speakers). One potential explanation for this is the influence of the global pandemic. Now, participants do not need to be physically present in a specific location to join a meeting, and, perhaps most significantly, there is no commute involved afterward—one is likely already home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the distribution of individual speeches remains “Normal” throughout the years, TT sessions became longer and take up to 40(!) minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime ~ Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n====================================================\n                Individual Time         TT Time     \n                      (1)                 (2)       \n----------------------------------------------------\nYear2012            34.977**            -130.545    \n                    (16.572)           (217.757)    \nYear2013            32.583**            -100.583    \n                    (16.279)           (213.902)    \nYear2016           45.750***             43.500     \n                    (16.918)           (222.294)    \nYear2017            36.850*              -1.000     \n                    (20.332)           (267.164)    \nYear2018           42.788***             73.423     \n                    (14.420)           (189.472)    \nYear2019           39.441***            321.941*    \n                    (13.331)           (175.163)    \nYear2020           43.136***           402.828**    \n                    (12.794)           (168.107)    \nYear2021           44.867***           467.536***   \n                    (12.719)           (167.132)    \nYear2022           46.424***           750.497***   \n                    (12.699)           (166.861)    \nConstant           61.750***           494.000***   \n                    (12.610)           (165.688)    \nObservations         1,432               1,432      \nR2                   0.013               0.155      \nAdjusted R2          0.006               0.150      \n----------------------------------------------------\nNotes:       ***Significant at the 1 percent level. \n             **Significant at the 5 percent level.  \n             *Significant at the 10 percent level.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAre there differences on the club level?\nFurther exploring the data, we look at whether some of the differences can be explained by looking at distributions at the club level.\n\n\nIndividual Time\nTT Session Time\nMen/Women Club\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual times don’t seem to vary that much across clubs, however KOMA (Ukrainian-speaking club) is an exception.

    "text": "How to win Table Topics session?\nIn this last section we will find out what it takes to win TT session!\nFirst of all, what doesn’t it mean “to win”? Winning means - majority voted for you and not someone else. Win can be attributed to 2 types of factors: internal and external. Internal factors can be broken down into articulation and story. Articulation is how well you communicate your idea/story: your vocal variety, vocal clarity, hand gestures, eye contact, stage movement, being timely, overall appearance, among other. Story has to do with your message to the audience. How clear is it, does it evoke emotion or make one think? Is there a flow to the speech, is it easy to follow?\nExternal factors can also be broken down into 2 categories: perception and environment. Perception is how your message is understood by the audience. This has to do with who those people are, what they find funny, what have they eaten before the meetings etc. Environment is the place where you give a speech. Zoom, in person, microphone quality, distance to the audience, acoustics…\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart made with ggflowchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat plays the biggest role in winning TT?\n\n\n\n\nEye contactBeing on timeBeing liked by the audienceKnowing your audienceEvoking emotionStructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we look at a set of hypothesis:\n\nThe last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT;\nThe longer the speech the less likely is winning;\nTime of other speakers has no effect on probability of winning\nBonus: how to name your baby so it wins TT\n\nHypothesis 1:\nThe last speaker has a higher probability of winning TT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Speaker Order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                              Individual Time            \n                       logistic             probit       \n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nSpeaker Order            0.009               0.005       \n                        (0.033)             (0.018)      \nObservations              679                 679        \nLog Likelihood         -278.435            -278.435      \nAkaike Inf.

There a lot that goes into giving a great speech and a lot more into winning, but speaker order doesn’t seem to be it. But one thing is clear here - the only people who don’t win are those that don’t try!\nHypothesis 2:\nThe likelihood of winning decreases as the length of the speech increases\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we have a dozen of TT winners who spoke over 150 seconds, we will remove them from our analysis and run regression with and w/o outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                                    TT                   \n                  Model with outliers  Model w/o outliers\n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nIndividual Time         0.008***            0.013***     \n                        (0.003)             (0.005)      \nConstant               -2.680***           -3.166***     \n                        (0.343)             (0.497)      \nObservations              679                 609        \nLog Likelihood          -274.566            -243.462     \nAkaike Inf.

Even removing outliers (150 seconds or higher) doesn’t change the significance. You still better speak for as long as and not a second more! Otherwise you’ll be disqualified!\nThink about how this finding plays out in your life.\nWhen you have someone’s attention, you have to be mindful of time. You are not given their attention indefinitely, you have to use this opportunity exhaustively, making every second count. Speak fast and blurt out your thought and they will not understand it fully. Speak too slow and they might switch off and think that you can’t properly articulate your thoughts. Place yourself in between these 2 extremes and finish by the time they lose focus!\nHypothesis 3:\nTime of other speakers has no effect on probability of winning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n================================================================\n                                           TT                   \n                         Model with outliers  Model w/o outliers\n                                 (1)                 (2)        \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nIndividual time                0.009**             0.013**      \n                               (0.004)             (0.005)      \nTime of previous speaker        0.000               0.001       \n                               (0.004)             (0.004)      \nTime of next speaker            -0.006             -0.007*      \n                               (0.004)             (0.004)      \nConstant                      -2.318***           -2.570***     \n                               (0.588)             (0.740)      \nObservations                     512                 460        \nLog Likelihood                 -196.804            -177.511     \nAkaike Inf.

Sometimes what beats a competition is competition itself. You can never underestimate your opponents, even when it fails miserably. Restricting our analysis to length of impromptu speech, the failure would be not using enough time (see H2). And our foes failing miserably would mean them not using enough time, which we don’t find to be significant in predicting winning TT.\nBonus:\nHow to name your baby so that it has a higher chances of winning TT?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWin ~ Time + Prev + Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression results\n=========================================================\n                                    TT                   \n                       logistic             probit       \n                          (1)                 (2)        \n---------------------------------------------------------\nTimur                    0.916               0.512       \n                        (1.162)             (0.685)      \nVadym                    0.852               0.474       \n                        (0.528)             (0.308)      \nNataly                  0.916*              0.512*       \n                        (0.489)             (0.286)      \nAlex                   1.322***            0.756***      \n                        (0.408)             (0.246)      \nAndrew                 1.253***             0.714**      \n                        (0.476)             (0.287)      \nConstant               -2.015***           -1.187***     \n                        (0.129)             (0.068)      \nObservations              679                 679        \nLog Likelihood         -269.486            -269.486      \nAkaike Inf.
