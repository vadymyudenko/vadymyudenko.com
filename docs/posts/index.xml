<p>“How I wish they would just shut up.”</p>
<p>Whether you are on a date, work meeting or family gathering, you can’t help but sigh when someone takes too long to articulate their thought. You’ve already understood the main point of whatever that it is that they are trying to say, but you wait, let them finish - we need to show respect. After a certain threshold you can hear teeth grinding, eyes rolling, feet shuffling, fingers fidgeting and omnipresent yawning. You don’t listen anymore, words fail to register flowing in and out of your head. All the while, the speaker (that someone) is oblivious to the damage he inflicts to others!</p>
<p>Now this is an extreme case of bad communication of which we have all been the victim and the perpetrator. Good (effective) communication requires time to be taken into consideration. One doesn’t have to talk for too long nor too short, but enough. When is enough? How to know how much one has to speak to deliver the message effectively? Also, what does effectiveness mean in the context of communication? Effectiveness in the military, for example, is about short and clear exchanges: “Roger that!”, “Copy that!”, “Tango down”, “Enemy 12 o’clock” - its goal is to deliver information that can be acted upon immediately. For academics effective communication is about articulating hard science in such a way a 5 year old can understand. Depending on the context effectiveness means different things: getting away with a lie, convincing someone to partner up, getting a “yes”, accurately giving a portrait of a criminal to the police.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Coming back to the example above, there are many things that might make us think someone would just shut up. Being overtime is one of them. I once heard a speech that took too long, the speaker kept repeating the same things over and over again. Later, to my surprise, the speech was voted as the best by meeting attendees - turns out the story was relatable and majority liked it. Others were okay listening much longer, while I was sent to a different dimension by the speech. This situation got me thinking just how important is the time in communication?<sup>1</sup></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;No doubt it is, but <strong>“can we quantify it?”</strong> is the main question of this research.</p></li></div></div>
<p>Measuring effectiveness of communication is not a straightforward task. In this article we study it via proxy with data from Toastmasters International, whose meetings have an impromptu session, where each participant is given 2 minutes to give a speech. After the last participant has concluded, everyone votes for the best speaker. Winning indicates an effective (good) speech, as it has achieved at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>was better than others;</p></li>
<li><p>communicated idea clearly;</p></li>
<li><p>was memorable or relatable;</p></li>
<li><p>happened (!)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following research looks at the data gathered during Toastmasters meetings and looks at how time of the speech is associated with speeches’ effectiveness (winning) and a slew of other interesting hypotheses.</p>

<section id="toastmasters-in-a-nutshell" class="level3 page-columns page-full"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="toastmasters-in-a-nutshell">Toastmasters in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>*For people who hear about Toastmasters for the first time.** This is a place to practice your public speaking skills. Each meeting, which typically lasts for 90 minutes, has a structure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Prepared speeches session:</strong> usually 5-7 mins long given by Club members;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Table Topics (TT)</strong> <strong>session:</strong> 2 mins impromptu speeches (everyone can participate), one can volunteer to answer a question or will be chosen by a toastmaster;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation session:</strong> everyone who came on stage during previous sessions is given feedback on how well they did.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Toastmasters are more organized and formal compared to many speaking clubs. Many of its members are <a href="https://www.toastmasters.org/resources/statistics-and-data-hub">middle-aged with higher education</a>. These people value their time and that is why among the evaluators there is a Timer (Ta-da!). Timer’s responsibility is to keep track of time and show colored signs to a speaker. Without going into much detail, <span style="color:green"><em>green</em></span> is an early warning, <span style="color:yellow"><em>yellow</em></span> - soon the time will be up, <span style="color:red"><em>red</em></span> - time is up, finish your speech. Timer also tracks the time of each speaker and presents the Timer Report - sine qua non<sup>2</sup> of this article.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A necessary condition without which something is not possible [from Latin]</p></li></div></div>
</section></section><section id="data" class="level2 page-columns page-full"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h2>
<p>Like a famished mouse looking for breadcrumbs under the baker’s table, the author was open-sourcing these reports from Telegram , Facebook , some were written by author himself and other were transcribed from videos of the meetings.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Most of the data was collected from Ukrainian TMCs: Chamber<sup>3</sup>, Arttalkers, Changemakers, Dniprohills, KOMA (UA-speaking) and Svoya Sorochka (UA-speaking). There are some reports from Japanese and Polish TMCs, but we will not be focusing on them.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Special thanks goes to Chamber and their Timer reports, without them this project would’ve taken much-much longer.</p></li></div></div>
</section><section id="note-on-timer-reports" class="level2 page-columns page-full"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="note-on-timer-reports">Note on Timer reports</h2>
<p>Timer tracks everyone’s time, as can be seen on the reports. Here we will be only looking at Table Topics <strong>(TT)</strong> session times. Reports usually have the following information useful for our analysis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Speaker Name</li>
<li>Speech Time</li>
<li>Club</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>TT winner<sup>4</sup>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;There are many reports that don’t include TT winner or times of some speakers. Some speaker volunteer two or more times, which complicates analysis.</p></li></div><p>I have looked at too much timer reports <em>(see examples by clicking on each Tab).</em> It is as boring as being a Timer - manual work, under-appreciated and no one really cares. However, I was delighted to come across some very fine reports - a bright spark in otherwise gloom sea of boringness. These people turned a mundane, just-get-it-over-with role and created something worthwhile - a memory. For a lurking, opportunistic Toastmasters anthropologist (author) that is for sure.</p>
<p>But by and large, reports are nothing special. Some people have created a nice Excel sheet to track the time, others write on piece of paper.</p>
<p>I sense that some of you keen readers might have a suspicion that the author is a little crazy - going through hundreds of reports himself! Yes, he is; and while you hold that thought, hear this: some timer went to the trouble of writing down time to milliseconds (!), yet another specimen had written a start time (to milliseconds of course) and end time and subtracted the two to get a total time. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! You think I’m crazy?</p>
<p>But without these crazy reports, I wouldn’t have went through with this article.</p>

<p>And lastly we have Time of Table Topics (TT)! How TT works:</p>
<p>You have 2 minutes to answer a question or speak on the given topic. <strong>To stay within time limits, the timer will show you <span style="color:green"><em>green</em></span> sign when there is 1 minute left, <span style="color:yellow"><em>yellow</em></span> when 30 seconds and <span style="color:red"><em>red</em></span> when time is up.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally you want to have an opening-body-conclusion short speech, but this isn’t always possible. You can volunteer or be dragged on stage. The question may be familiar to you or something you haven’t even thought about. That is all to say, there are many different things happening during TT sessions and winning it requires achieving many things. At the end of TT everyone votes for “the best speech” - <strong>this is our dependent variable of interest.</strong></p>

<p>The answer? The difference is not significant! The distributions closely resemble each other. <em>Women don’t speak longer than men!</em></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Women actually speak a little less than men. However we cannot say that women ACTUALLY talk less! In the current study we only observe time taken to speak, however within these 2 minutes on stage, they might talk more (on average) than men. There seem to be report that women communicate ideas differently and <a href="https://www.imd.org/research-knowledge/leadership/articles/women-talk-too-much-simply-isnt-true-data-show/">use more words</a> like ah/uh/m-m-m/you know/so/like<sup>7</sup>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn7"><p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Foreshadowing a future ah-counter perspective on winning TT?!</p></li></div></div>
<p>Strangely enough, if the proportion of men in TT session increases - then TT session will be be shorter. Also, having more men speak during TT session is associated with lower TT times.</p>

<p>In-person conversations/presentation have you deal with people - you see/hear/feel/smell them every second of your speech. There are so many signals communicated non-verbally that we don’t even notice them. During in-person meetings when you take too long to finish people start fidgeting, yawning, looking away, and you know you don’t want to make them uncomfortable so you quickly wrap up your speech. Online you deal with avatars, the only means of communication with them (your audience) is by observing their reaction. Perhaps this makes you go overtime more often than you would’ve had you given a particular speech in person. We test this below:</p>

<p>Whether the meeting is online or offline has no effect on speech lengths, however there is a strong association with total TT session time: on average online TT sessions are longer than in-person ones by 160 secs (~1.5 speakers). One possible explanation for this is the fact that one doesn’t have to go home after the meeting, working from home and joining the meeting without spending hours commuting enables all participants to answer a question during TT.</p>

<p>Individual times don’t seem to vary that much across clubs, however KOMA (Ukrainian-speaking club) is an exception. The mean of their speakers’ Time is higher and variance is even higher. As for distribution of gender of participants one can see the clubs that have more women or men participating. This part could be improved with more data.</p>

<p>In this last section we will find out what it takes to win TT session!</p>
<p>First of all, what doesn’t it mean “to win”? Winning means - majority voted for you and not someone else. Win can be attributed to 2 types of factors: internal and external. Internal factors can be broken down into articulation and story. Articulation is how well you communicate your idea/story: your vocal variety, vocal clarity, hand gestures, eye contact, stage movement, being timely, overall appearance, among other. Story has to do with your message to the audience. How clear is it, does it evoke emotion or make one think? Is there a flow to the speech, is it easy to follow?</p>
<p>External factors can also be broken down into 2 categories: perception and environment. Perception is how your message is understood by the audience. This has to do with who those people are, what they find funny, what have they eaten before the meetings etc. Environment is the place where you give a speech. Zoom, in person, microphone quality, distance to the audience, acoustics…</p>

<p>Waiting and speaking later during TT session does indeed increases the probability of winning by a whopping 0.9%!</p>
<p>This is a great news, because you can’t expect to win by just waiting and giving a speech at the end of TT session. There a lot that goes into giving a great speech and a lot more into winning, but speaker order doesn’t seem to be it. But one thing is clear as day here - the only people who don’t win are those that don’t try!</p>

<p>Regardless of outliers, model is statistically significant. Interestingly, that probability of winning TT is increasing with every second (!) removing outliers (150 seconds or higher) doesn’t change the probability. Conclusion: you want to speak for as long as and not a second more! Otherwise you’ll be disqualified.</p>
<p>Think about how this finding plays out in your life.</p>
<p>When you have someones attention you have to be mindful of time. You are not given their attention indefinitely, you have to use this opportunity exhaustively making every second count. Speak fast and blurt out your thought and they will not understand it fully. Speak too much and they switch off and feel like you can’t properly articulate your thoughts. You have to finish by the time they lose focus!</p>

<p>If your name is not Alex or Andrew, than maybe it is not for you. Go apply yourself in some other domain, for you are against the odds when it comes to winning TT session.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Time does affect the effectiveness of one’s speech. In situations where going overtime isn’t punished, you better take as much time as possible. If you have time, use it.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot cheat others by choosing to speak in any specific order. On average you are just as likely to win speaking first as speaking last.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no differences in speaking patters between men and women - they speak on average the same amount.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I do hope that you, the keen reader, have found this piece entertaining and useful. Be mindful of time and learn to use it to its utmost limit and not a second more - good things will come your way!</p>
